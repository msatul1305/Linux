      - multifaceteted approach to storage infrastructure
        - Standard vs Premium performance tiers
        - Access tiers (Hot, Cool, Cold and Archive)

    - Types: Standard HDD, Standard SSD, Premium SSD, Ultra Disk
  - Azure File Storage(Azure Files)
    - Fully managed file shares in the cloud
    - SMB and NFS protocols supported
    - like a network drive in on-premises environments
  - Queue Storage
    - Message queuing for communication between application components
    - When use Queue Storage over Azure Service Bus or Azure Event Hub
      - Decoupling application components
      - Load leveling
      - Asynchronous processing
  - Azure Table Storage
    - NoSQL key-value store for semi-structured data
- Factors to Consider for Cost Optimization
  - Access Patterns
    - Frequency of data access (Hot, Cool, Archive tiers)
    - Read vs write operations
  - Data Redundancy Options
    - Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)
      - Storage account located in a
        - single data center
        - single region
        - 3 copies of data within that region
    - Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)
      - protection from regional outages
      - replicates data to a secondary region hundreds of miles away from the primary region
      - 6 total copies of data (3 in primary region, 3 in secondary region)
      - costs more than LRS
      - longer recovery times in case of failover
      - suitable for applications requiring high availability and disaster recovery
    - Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS)
      - No downside if primary region goes down
      - read access to data in secondary region
      - ideal for read-heavy workloads requiring high availability across regions
      - additional cost compared to GRS
    - Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)
      - 3 copies of data 
        - but across multiple availability zones within a region
      - protects against data center failures within a region
      - typically more expensive than LRS but less than GRS
      - suitable for applications requiring high availability without cross-region replication
    - GZRS (Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage)
      - combines benefits of ZRS and GRS
      - replicates data across multiple availability zones in primary region and to a secondary region
      - highest level of durability and availability
      - incurs higher costs
      - ideal for mission-critical applications requiring maximum resilience
  - Performance Tiers
    - Standard vs Premium storage options
  - Data Lifecycle Management
    - Implementing policies to transition data between access tiers based on usage patterns
- Tiers for blob storage
  - Hot
    - frequently accessed data
    - highest storage costs
    - lowest access costs
    - retrieval times are the fastest: seconds or milliseconds
  - Cool
    - Monthly accessed data
    - early deletion penalties
      - data must be stored for a minimum of 30 days to avoid early deletion charges
      - (i.e.30 days minimum storage duration charge to be levied)
  - Cold
    - Quarterly accessed data
    - early deletion penalties
      - data must be stored for a minimum of 90 days to avoid early deletion charges
  - Archive
    - for compliance or historical data that is rarely accessed
    - lowest storage costs
    - retrieval costs are the highest
    - data retrieval can take several minutes and hours
    - rehydrating
      - data must be rehydrated to an online tier (Hot or Cool) before it can be accessed
    - early deletion penalties
      - data must be stored for a minimum of 180 days to avoid early deletion charges
- Automation to optimize storage costs
  - Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle Management(move data between blob tiers)
    - automated policies to transition blobs between access tiers based on age or last accessed time
    - helps optimize storage costs by ensuring data is stored in the most cost-effective tier based on usage patterns
    - example policy
      - move blobs to Cool tier after 30 days of inactivity
      - move blobs to Archive tier after 90 days of inactivity
      - delete blobs after 365 days
    - offers ability to manage automatic deletion of data
  - Azure Storage Tasks
    - automate manual or scheduled operations to manage and maintain storage accounts
    - includes tasks such as data migration, backup, and replication
    - not specifically focused on cost optimization through tiering
    - can move data between tiers
    - can manage delete as a task
- Azure Storage Metrics Categories
  - Capacity Metrics
    - Total storage used across all storage accounts
    - Number of blobs, files, tables, and queues
