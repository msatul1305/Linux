- VM considerations
  - Basics
    - OS: Linux or Windows
    - Purpose/Environment:
      - Development,
      - Testing,
      - Production
    - Region: e.g., East US, West Europe
    - Tier: 
      - General Purpose
      - Compute Optimized
      - Memory Optimized
      - Storage Optimized
  - Category
    - compute-optimized
    - memory-optimized
    - storage-optimized
    - general-purpose
    - GPU
    - high-performance compute (HPC)
  - Specific Instance
    - Series: e.g., D-series, E-series, F-series
    - Storage Type: 
      - Standard HDD
      - Standard SSD
      - Premium SSD
      - Ultra Disk
    - compute-to-memory ratio
  - Scaling Options
    - Vertical Scaling (Resize)
      - Change VM size to adjust CPU, memory, and storage resources
    - Horizontal Scaling
      - Use Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) to add or remove VM instances based on demand
  - Savings Options
    - Pay-as-you-go
      - No upfront commitment, pay for what you use
    - Reserved Instances
      - Commit to a 1-year or 3-year term for significant cost savings
    - Spot Instances
      - Utilize unused Azure capacity at a discounted rate for non-critical workloads
- Scaling Strategies
  - Manual Scaling(Steady state)
    - Adjust the number of VM instances based on anticipated demand
  - Autoscaling(Variable, Known patterns)
    - Configure rules to automatically scale VM instances based on metrics like CPU usage or memory consumption
  - Vm scale sets(High scalability, High availability)
    - Deploy and manage a set of identical VMs that can automatically scale in or out based on demand
