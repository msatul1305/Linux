- Exports
  - allow the capture of datasets related to cost management
  - exported to Azure storage accounts, Event Hubs, or Log Analytics
- Initiatives
  - logical grouping of related Azure resources/policy rules/definitions
    - e.g. bundling all cost related rules into a single initiative
  - help manage and enforce policies across multiple resources
- Azure Log Quering Language
  - Kusto Query Language (KQL)
  - used to query and analyze data in Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights
  - powerful tool for extracting insights from large datasets
  - cost management data can be queried using KQL to identify trends, anomalies, and optimization opportunities
  - example KQL query to analyze cost data
    ```kql
    CostManagementResources
    | summarize TotalCost = sum(Cost) by ResourceGroup, bin(Timestamp, 1d)
    | order by TotalCost desc
    ```
