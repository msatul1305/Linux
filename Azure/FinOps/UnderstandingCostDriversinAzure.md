- FinOps Phases
  - Inform
    - gather data on who need which cloud services and why
    - understanding how the services are billed
  - Optimize
    - analyze usage patterns and identify cost-saving opportunities
    - right-sizing resources, eliminating unused services, and leveraging discounts
  - Operate
    - run, log and monitor cloud services efficiently
- Cost Drivers in Azure
  - Compute
    - Virtual Machines (VMs)
    - App Services
    - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
    - Functions
  - Storage
    - Blob Storage
    - Disk Storage
    - File Storage
    - Archive Storage
  - Networking
    - Data Transfer (egress and ingress)
      - mostly outbound data transfer (egress) incurs costs
    - Virtual Network (VNet) Peering
    - Load Balancers
    - VPN Gateways
  - Databases
    - Azure SQL Database
    - Cosmos DB
      - Billing units are called Request Units (RUs) per second
    - Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL
  - Other Services
    - AI and Machine Learning services
    - Analytics services (e.g., Azure Synapse Analytics)
    - IoT services
  - Charge Per API calls or per execution
    - Some services charge based on the number of API calls made
    - Examples include Azure Cognitive Services and Azure Maps
    - Logic Apps
    - Functions
  - Licensing and Software Costs
    - Some Azure services require additional licensing fees
    - Examples include Windows Server licenses for VMs and SQL Server licenses for databases
  - Deployment region
    - Costs can vary significantly based on the Azure region where resources are deployed
    - Factors influencing regional costs include infrastructure costs, demand, and regional regulations
  - Operational Costs
    - Monitoring and management tools
    - Backup and disaster recovery solutions
    - Security services
    - Support plans
    - Compliance requirements
  - Security and Compliance
    - Implementing security measures and compliance requirements can add to costs
    - Examples include Azure Security Center and Azure Policy
    - Enhanced security like Defender may cost additional fees
- Controlling Cost at resource creation
  - Tags
    - Examples of tags
      - Environment: Production, Staging, Development
      - Owner/Department: HR, Finance, IT, Marketing
      - Project: ProjectA, ProjectB
  - Azure Policy
    - what is allowed and not allowed in the subscription
    - e.g.
      - limit the type and size of VMs that can be created
  - Using IaC (Infrastructure as Code) to deploy resources
    - Use IaC tools like 
      - Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, 
      - Terraform, or 
      - Bicep to 
      - define and deploy resources consistently
    - Benefits include version control, repeatability, and easier management of resource configurations
- Business impact of Good Cost Management
    - Operational Efficiency gains and right-sized resource utilization
    - Scalability, Flexibility and Customer experience
    - Risk management and Compliance adherence
    - Innovation and agile development
    - Data-Driven Decision-Making and cost predictability
- 15 ways to reduce overspend in Azure
  - using Tags
  - utilizing Azure Cost Management tool
    - Budgeting, Cost Management, and biling tools
    - Budgeting rules
  - Identifying idle resources
  - Right-sizing resources for development and testing
  - understanding pricing models
  - using reserved instances for predictable workloads
  - Donot overprovision resources
    - Scale up or scale out as needed
    - adequate scaling practices
  - optimize database costs
    - automatic scaling
    - performance tuning recommendations
      - Azure Advisor
      - Azure SQL Analytics
  - optimize networking costs
    - Keep in mind Data egress charges
    - Dont use VPN gateways or ExpressRoute for large data transfers
  - Licensing cost
    - Windows Server
    - SQL Server
  - monitoring of third party apps
  - Monitor Azure updates and changes
    - Price and model changes
  - Governance policies and Policy Management
    - enforce tagging policies
    - resource creation policies
  - Engaging teams in cost management
    - FinOps practices
- Azure Cost Management and Billing Dashboard
  - Cost Analysis
    - Analyze costs by resource, resource group, service, location, and tags
    - Identify spending trends and patterns over time
  - Budgets and Alerts
    - Set budgets for subscriptions or resource groups
    - Receive alerts when spending exceeds predefined thresholds
  - Recommendations
    - Get cost-saving recommendations based on usage patterns
    - Identify underutilized resources that can be resized or shut down
  - Cost Allocation and Chargeback
    - Use tags to allocate costs to different departments or projects
    - Generate reports for chargeback purposes
  - Power BI Integration
    - Connect Power BI to Azure Cost Management data for advanced reporting
    - Create custom reports and dashboards tailored to organizational needs
