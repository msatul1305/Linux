    - Regression evaluation metrics
      - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
        - indicates by how many items each prediction was wrong. 
        - for example, -3 and +3 both indicate a variance of 3
        - i.e. It doesn't matter if the prediction was over or under the actual value
        - it takes all discrepancies between predicted and actual labels into account equally
      - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
        - produce a metric that "amplifies" larger errors by squaring the individual errors and 
        - calculating the mean of the squared values.
        - squares the error values
      - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
        - to measure the error in terms of the number of items back from MSE
        - compare the discrepancy between the predicted and actual values in order to evaluate the model.
      - Coefficient of determination or R-squared (R2)
        - measures the proportion of variance in the validation results 
        - that can be explained by the model, as opposed to some anomalous aspect of the validation data 
        - for example
          - a day with a highly unusual number of ice creams sales because of a local festival
        - It compares the sum of squared differences between predicted and actual labels 
          - with the sum of squared differences between the actual label values and the mean of actual label values, 
          - like this:
            - R2 = 1- ∑(y-ŷ)2 ÷ ∑(y-ȳ)2
            - where:
              - y = actual label value
              - ŷ = predicted label value
              - ȳ = mean of actual label values
        - result is a value between 0 and 1 that describes the proportion of variance explained by the model.

- Classification
  - Supervised Machine Learning Technique
  - e.g. Two-Class Logistic Regression
  - train ML model to predict which category or class an item belongs to
    - e.g. Health clinic uses 
      - Features: characteristics of patient
        - like age, weight, blood pressure
      - Label: Predict Diabetic or Non-Diabetic
        - if patient is at risk of diabetes
  - using Azure ML Designer
- Compute Targets
  - Compute Instances: Development workstations that data scientists can use to work with data and models.
  - Compute Clusters: Scalable clusters of virtual machines for on-demand processing of experiment code. 
  - Inference Clusters: Deployment targets for predictive services that use your trained models.
  - Attached Compute: Links to existing Microsoft Azure compute resources, such as Virtual Machines or Azure Databricks cluster
-  different classification algorithms
  - Two-Class Decision Forest
  - Two-Class Logistic Regression
  - Two-Class Support Vector Machine
  - Two-Class Neural Network
  - Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree
  - Two-Class Averaged Perceptron
- multiclass classification model
  - One-vs-Rest (OvR) algorithms 
    - train a binary classification function for each class
    - each calculating the probability that the observation is an example of the target class.
    - Each function calculates the probability of the observation being a specific class compared to any other class.
    - f0(x) = P(y=0 | x)
      f1(x) = P(y=1 | x)
      f2(x) = P(y=2 | x)
    - Each algorithm produces a sigmoid function that calculates a probability value between 0.0 and 1.0.
    - produces the highest probability output.
  - Multinomial algorithms
    - creates a single function that returns a multivalued output.
    - The output is a vector (an array of values) that contains the probability distribution 
      - for all possible classes - with a probability score for each class 
      - which when totaled add up to 1.0
      - e.g. [0.2, 0.3, 0.5]
- Clustering
  - group similar items into clusters based on their features
  - e.g. Size of Penguin
    - group based on similarity/characteristics/features
  - Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm
  - No previously known cluster values or labels to train model
  - When evaluating a clustering model, what metrics can you visualize in the Evaluate results section?
    - Average distance to cluster center
      - How close, on average, each point in the cluster is to the centroid of the cluster.
    - Average distance to other center
      - How close, on average, each point in the cluster is to the centroid of all other clusters.
    - Maximal distance to cluster center
      - The furthest distance between a point in the cluster and its centroid.
    - Number of points
    - Silhouette
      - A value between -1 and 1 that summarizes the ratio of distance 
        - between points in the same cluster and points in different clusters 
        - (The closer to 1, the better the cluster separation).
