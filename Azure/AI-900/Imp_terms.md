- ROC curve
  - Received Operating Characteristic curve
- Precision-recall curve
- Lift curve
- confusion matrix
  - tabulation of the predicted and actual value counts for each possible class. 
  - It is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.
  - It is a 2x2 matrix
    - True Positive(TP)
      - both the predicted and actual values were 1
    - True Negative(TN)
      - both the predicted and the actual values were 0
    - False Positive(FP)
    - False Negative(FN)
    - Accuracy = (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)
      - The ratio of correct predictions (true positives + true negatives) to the total number of predictions. 
      - In other words, what proportion of diabetes predictions did the model get right?
      - not good for imbalanced data
        - Suppose that only 3% of the population is diabetic. 
        - You could create a model that always predicts 0 and 
        - it would be 97% accurate
    - Precision = TP/(TP+FP)
      -  The fraction of positive cases correctly identified 
      - (the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus false positives).
      - In other words, out of all the patients that the model predicted as having diabetes, how many are actually diabetic?
    - Recall(True positive rate) = TP/(TP+FN)
      - The fraction of the cases classified as positive that are actually positive 
      - (the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus false negatives). 
      - In other words, out of all the patients who actually have diabetes, how many did the model identify?
    - F1 Score = 2*(Recall * Precision) / (Recall + Precision)
      - An overall metric that essentially combines precision and recall.
    - Specificity = TN/(TN+FP)
    - Sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN)
    - Type I error = FP/(FP+TN)
    - Type II error = FN/(FN+TP)
    - False Positive Rate = FP/(FP+TN)
    - False Negative Rate = FN/(FN+TP)
    - True Positive Rate = TP/(TP+FN)
    - True Negative Rate = TN/(TN+FP)
    - Confusion matrix is used to calculate these metrics
    - AUC
      - Area under the curve
      - The larger the area under the curve (which can be any value from 0 to 1), the better the model is performing - this is the AUC metric listed with the other metrics below.
    - Threshold slider
      - The threshold slider is used to adjust the threshold for classification.
- loss function
  - To evaluate the aggregate difference between predicted and actual label values
- Multi-service resource
  - the AI service resource created in the Azure portal that provides access to a bundle of AI services.
- Single-service resource
  - a resource created in the Azure portal that provides access to a single Azure AI service, such as Speech, Vision, Language, etc. Each Azure AI service has a unique key and endpoint.
- convolutional filtering.
  - filter is convolved across the image
  - laplace filter
  - other kinds of filter
    - use to create blurring, sharpening, color inversion, and other effects.
- softmax function
- conversational language understanding (CLU)
  - turn devices on and off based on speech
