- Azure AI Search
  - extract data from various structured, semi-structured, and non-structured documents.
  - Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution
  - programmable search engine built on Apache Lucene
    - open-source software library
  - Data from any source
    - in JSON format
    - auto crawling support for selected data sources in Azure
  - Multiple options for search and analysis
    - vector search, full text, and hybrid search.
  - AI enrichment: 
    - has Azure AI capabilities built in for image and text analysis from raw content.
  - Linguistic analysis: 
    - offers analysis for 56 languages to intelligently handle phonetic matching or language-specific linguistics. 
    - Natural language processors available in Azure AI Search are also used by Bing and Office. 
  - Configurable user experience: 
    - has options for query syntax including vector queries, 
    - text search, 
    - hybrid queries, 
    - fuzzy search, 
    - autocomplete, 
    - geo-search filtering based on proximity to a physical location, etc.
  - Azure scale, security, and integration: 
    - at the data layer, machine learning layer, and with Azure AI services and Azure OpenAI.
- search index
  - create a search index by moving data through the following indexing pipeline:
    - Start with a data source
      - storage location of your original data artifacts, such as PDFs, video files, and images.
      - files in Azure Storage, or text in a database such as Azure SQL Database or Azure Cosmos DB.
    - Indexer
      - automates a portion of data ingestion and exports the original file type to JSON (in an action called JSON serialization).
    - Document cracking
      - opens files and extracts content.
    - Enrichment
      - implements Azure AI on your original data to extract more information.
      - adding and combining skills in a skillset
        - using text translation or Optical Character Recognition (OCR), or custom skills
        - Example: adding captions to a photo and evaluating text sentiment
      - sent to knowledge store
        - persists output from an AI enrichment pipeline in tables and blobs in Azure Storage for independent analysis or downstream processing.
    - Push to index
      - serialized JSON data populates the search index.
    - The result is a populated search index
      - explored through queries
      - search engine looks for that information in the search index.
      - search index structure similar to a table, known as the index schema
        - contains a set of fields and field attributes
        - fields store searchable text
        - field attributes allow for actions such as filtering and sorting.
