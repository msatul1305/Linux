- SKU = Stock Keeping Unit
  - A unique identifier for each distinct product and service that can be purchased.
  - Used for inventory management, pricing, and tracking sales.
  - In cloud services like Azure, SKUs represent different configurations or tiers of services.
  - Examples:
    - Virtual Machines: Different SKUs for various sizes and capabilities (e.g., Standard_DS1_v2, Standard_F4s).
    - Storage Accounts: Different SKUs based on performance and redundancy options (e.g., Standard_LRS, Premium_ZRS).
    - Databases: Different SKUs for database services based on performance levels (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium).
