    - **Web test location**: Choose the location closest to your web app's primary location.
6. Click on the "Review + create" button and then "Create" to create the Application Insights resource.

### Step 2: Instrument the Web App

1. Depending on your web app's technology stack, add the Application Insights SDK to your application code.
2. For .NET web apps, you can install the "Microsoft.ApplicationInsights" NuGet package and configure it in your `Startup.cs` or `Web.config` file.
3. For Node.js web apps, you can install the "applicationinsights" npm package and configure it in your code.

### Step 3: Set up Availability Tests (Optional)

1. Open the Application Insights resource in the Azure portal.
2. In the left-hand menu, click on "Availability" under the "Monitoring" section.
3. Click on the "+ Add Test" button to create a new availability test.
4. Configure the test details, such as the test type (URL Ping Test or Multi-Step Web Test), locations, test URL or steps, and test frequency.
5. Click on the "Create" button to save the availability test.

### Step 4: Add Alert Rules (Optional)

1. Go back to the Application Insights resource in the Azure portal.
2. In the left-hand menu, click on "Alerts."
3. Click on the "+ New alert rule" button to create a new alert rule.
4. Configure the scope and condition of the alert rule based on the availability test results or other metrics.
5. Configure the action group to be notified when the alert is triggered (e.g., email, SMS, webhook).
6. Click on the "Create alert rule" button to save the alert rule.

That's it! You have now configured Application Insights for your web app, allowing you to monitor its performance, detect issues, and gain insights into user interactions.
