- Selecting a Messaging solution
    - Queue vs Service bus
      - Queue = Producer-Consumer(one-to-one)
      - Service Bus = Publisher-Subscriber(one-to-many)(broadcast)
    - use Queue Storage if
        - storage needs > 80 GB
        - Server side logs needed for all transactions executed against the queue
        - app need to track progress of message processing
          - i.e. if worker processing a queue crashes, another worker can continue where it left off.
    - use Service bus if:
        - need support for receiving messages without polling (with AMQP 1.0)
          - Polling: process of checking for new data or updates periodically. 
            - It involves continuously sending requests or queries to a data source or server at regular intervals 
            - to inquire if there are any updates or changes.
        - guarantee message ordering(FIFO)
        - detect duplicate messages
        - up to 256 KB size messages
        - support topic-based notifications(one to many)
        - support publishing and consuming messages in batch
- Events vs Messaging Services
  - Event Grid
    - Purpose: reactive programming
    - Type: Event distribution(discrete)
    - When to use: React to status changes
  - Event Hubs
      - Purpose: Big data pipeline
      - Type: Event streaming(series)
      - When to use: Telemetry and distributed data streaming
  - Service Bus
      - Purpose: High-value enterprise messaging
      - Type: Message
      - When to use: Order processing and financial transactions
