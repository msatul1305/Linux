- Web 1.0	
  - 1990s–2000s	Read-only websites (static pages).
- current model (Web 2.0)
  - large corporations control most of the data and platforms 
  - like Google, Facebook, Amazon
  - Interactive, social, user-generated content.
- web3
  - next generation of the internet 
  - Decentralized, trustless, blockchain-driven.
  - built on decentralized technologies like blockchain
  - aim
    - Remove intermediaries (no central authorities like Google, Meta)
    - Use cryptocurrencies and tokens as native payment layers
    - Let users own their data, identity, and digital assets 
- key Web3 ideas:
  - Decentralized apps (dApps)
  - Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
  - Smart contracts (self-executing code on blockchains)
  - DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations)
  - NFTs, DeFi, etc.
- Key Features
  - Decentralization
    - No central authority—data is distributed across the network (like blockchain).
  - Blockchain-based
    - Uses blockchain for secure, transparent transactions and data management.
  - User ownership
    - Users own their data and digital assets (e.g., NFTs, tokens).
  - Smart Contracts
    - Code that runs automatically on blockchains when conditions are met.
  - Cryptocurrency
    - Digital currencies like Ethereum are often used for transactions and access.
  - Semantic Web
    - Machines can understand data more intelligently (like relationships and context).
  - AI and Machine Learning
    - More intelligent applications that can offer personalized experiences.
- Web 3.0 Applications:
  - Ethereum (blockchain platform)
  - Metamask (crypto wallet)
  - Uniswap (decentralized exchange)
  - IPFS (distributed file storage)
  - Decentraland (virtual world using blockchain)
  - Lens Protocol (Web3 social network)
- Key concepts
  - Wallet	
    - blockchain wallet (like MetaMask or Phantom) stores your crypto and 
      - digital identity.
  - Tokenomics
    - The economical design of a crypto/token project, 
      - involving supply, distribution, and use cases.
  - DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)
    - community-led organization with no centralized leadership, governed by smart contracts and token votes.
  - Interoperability	
    - Connecting different blockchain networks so they can share information (e.g., Cosmos, Polkadot). 
  - Zero-Knowledge Proofs
    - Cryptographic method that allows someone to prove a statement without revealing the actual data. 
    - Helps with privacy.
