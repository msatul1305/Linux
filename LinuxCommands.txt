On most Linux systems a program called bash (which stands for Bourne Again SHell, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, sh, written by Steve Bourne) acts as the shell program. Besides bash, there are other shell programs available for Linux systems. These include: ksh, tcsh and zsh.

What's a "Terminal?"
This is a program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell. Some Linux distributions install several. These might include gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm, rxvt, kvt, nxterm, and eterm.

If the last character of your shell prompt is # rather than $, you are operating as the superuser. 

Format of any linux command: 
	command -options arguments 
	eg. ls -l /etc
	
File Permissions
A representation of the file's access permissions. 
- rw- --- --- = (1,3,3,3) = (type, file's_owner, file's_group, everybody_else)
The first character is the type of file. 
	"-" indicates a regular (ordinary) file. 
	"d" indicates a directory.
The second set of three characters represent the read, write, and execution rights of the file's owner. 
The next three represent the rights of the file's group, and the 
final three represent the rights granted to everybody else.
eg. drwxr-xr-x  6 me  me  1024 Oct 9 2019 web_page

-rw-------   1 me       me            576 Apr 17  2019 weather.txt
drwxr-xr-x   6 me       me           1024 Oct  9  2019 web_page
-rw-rw-r--   1 me       me         276480 Feb 11 20:41 web_site.tar

ASCII text. ASCII (pronounced "As-Key") is short for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. This is a simple encoding scheme that was first used on Teletype machines to map keyboard characters to numbers.
Text is a simple one-to-one mapping of characters to numbers. It is very compact. Fifty characters of text translates to fifty bytes of data.
i.e. 1 character = 1 byte data = 8 bits data. that's why ASCII = 8 bits(0 to 2^7 or 127)

Less command:
less is a program that lets us view text files. This is very handy since many of the files used to control and configure Linux are human readable.
eg. less text_file
Controlling less
Once started, less will display the text file one page at a time. We can use the Page Up and Page Down keys to move through the text file. To exit less, we type "q". Here are some commands that less will accept:

Keyboard commands for the less program
Command	Action
Page Up or b	Scroll back one page
Page Down or space	Scroll forward one page
G	Go to the end of the text file
1G	Go to the beginning of the text file
/characters	Search forward in the text file for an occurrence of the specified characters
n	Repeat the previous search
h	Display a complete list less commands and options
q	Quit
