- OOA&D
    - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design
        - Brett D. McLaughlin, Gary Pollice & David West (Head First, O'Reilly)
    - Principles:
        1. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
            - Closed for Modification but
            - Open for Extension
        2. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
        3. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
        4. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
            - subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
                - i.e. well-designed inheritance
                    - ability to substitute subclass for base class without hassle
