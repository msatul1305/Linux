- OOPS concepts - Object-Oriented Programming Structure/System
    - Encapsulation
        - localize changes required for particular class/object
        - divide parts that change frequently vs static parts
    - Polymorphism
    - Data Hiding, Abstraction
    - Inheritance
    - Loose Coupling
    - Interface
        - define behaviour of inheriting classes
    - Delegation
        - hand over responsibility of particular task to another class or method
    - Composition
        - use behaviour from a family of other classes,
        - and to change that behaviour at runtime
    - Aggregation
        - one class is used as part of another class,
        - but still exists outside that other class
- OOAD concepts - Object-oriented analysis and design
    - write use cases
        - identify all nouns = classes
        - identify all verbs = methods
        - identify all properties = data/variables
- Features of good OO program
    - Flexible
    - Reusable
