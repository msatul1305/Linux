  - Header file: Contains C++ source code, and they are mostly used to make declarations, 
    - i.e., they contain the stubs that tell the compiler about the "things" that exists (somewhere). 
    - Usual extensions: .hpp, .h, or .hxx.
  - Source file: Contains C++ source code, and they are exclusively used for definitions, i.e., the actual implementation of the "things" that make up the program or library. 
    - Usual extensions: .cpp, .C, or .cxx (normally, .c is reserved for C source files, not C++).
  - Translation unit (TU): A technical term for a source file, once the compiler has looked at all #include statements and substituted them for the header files they refer to.
  - Object file: Simplest binary file which comes from the compilation of a single translation unit (TU) into executable code. 
    - Usual extensions: .o or .obj (MSVC).
  - Static library (or static-link library): A binary file which is very similar to an object file but is larger and 
    - usually the product of many object files combined into one file for convenience. 
    - The GNU stack refers to static libraries as archives, 
    - i.e., collections of object files. Usual extensions: .a or .lib (MSVC).
  - Import library: A special static library that is used by the MSVC toolset to make the static link 
    - between a standalone executable and a dynamic-link library (DLL).
  - Dynamic library (or dynamic-link library or shared object): A binary file also created from a set of object files, 
    - but they are packaged as a standalone executable library (not a program). 
    - Usual extensions: .so (POSIX) or .dll (Windows).
  - Executable program: This is a type of binary file that can be started and executed, 
    - i.e., it has an execution entry-point. In short, this is a program you can run. 
    - Usual extensions: <nothing> (POSIX) or .exe (Windows).
- Compilation of C/C++ code happens in three main steps (excl. linking), which could roughly be grouped under three terms:
  - Pre-processing
    - first major pass over the entire source code.
    - anything in C/C++ code that begins with a # character is a pre-processor command.
    - The pre-processor is mostly a glorified find-and-replace tool.
  - Syntactic analysis
    - parsing that checks language rules and builds an internal representation of the code.
    - compiler tries to "understand" your code. 
    - The language standard (e.g., C++ ISO Standard) describes how the compiler should interpret / understand the code.
  - Code generation
    - last big step in the compilation process, i.e., producing the binary code.
    - Once the compiler has done syntactic analysis and performed some high-level optimizations, 
    - it produces an early translation into a very simple language, usually referred to as Intermediate Language (IL), 
    - which is usually somewhere between a C dialect and a kind of platform-independent pseudo-assembly language 
    - (e.g., Comeau's IL is ANSI C, while GCC's IL looks more like an assembly language).
