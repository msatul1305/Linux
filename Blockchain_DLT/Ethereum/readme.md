# Ethereum(ETH)

- ETH
  - 2013-14
  - Founder: Vitalik Buterin
  - Ethereum programming language: Solidity
    - uses smart contracts
    - contract
      - set of if and then(condition and action)
      - Disadvantages of smart contracts:
        - Self executing
          - e.g. locking out tenant if they didn't pay their rent
        - hence, it is not intelligent!
        - i.e. letter strict
        - Immutable
          - once contract is deployed in the ethereum network, it cannot be edited or corrected even by its original author.
        - made for complex contracts which are difficult to secure.
        - DAO event:
          - code is law: whatever written must be abided by
          - used by hacker to drain DAO out of money using loopholes in the contract.
  - Ethereum's currency: ETHER
  - need to pay to deploy something on ethereum network
  - Improvement in ETH:
    - Ethereum classic(ETC): original ethereum
    - Ethereum(ETH):
      - forked from Ethereum
      - code is no longer the law

- ETHEREUM Wallets
  - Also, called client
  - holds private key to have control over the coins
  - public ethereum address: can be used by people to send ETHER(ETH).
  - Ethereum Accounts
    - Externally Owned Account(EOA): Ethereum address + Private key
      - ability to create contracts and trigger them
      - controlled by the private key
      - can send/receive ETH
    - Contract account
      - Accounts with code associated with them.
      - no private key
      - controlled by the code
      - can send/receive ETH
  - Ethereum transactions
    - wraps messages inside them to transfer ETH from account to account
    - uses of ETH transactions:
      - transfer of value: i.e. money(send ETH between accounts)
      - create contracts
        - i.e. sending a transaction containing contract's code
      - trigger contracts
  - ETH wallets
    - also called clients/nodes
    - types:
      - smart contract wallets:
        - which allows contracts
      - eth wallets
        - only eth transfer
        - no contracts
    - types of clients/node
      - Full client/node
        - hold entire blockchain copy since inception
        - need no 3rd party reliance for verifying transactions
        - disadvantages:
          - increased memory usage
          - computer usage
          - harder to operate
        - e.g.
          - Geth(Go Ethereum)
            - developed by ethereum foundation
          - Mist
            - GUI
          - Parity
            - private company
      - Light node
        - similar to bitcoin's SPV wallets
        - rely on 3rd party full nodes to get information when needed rather than holding full copy of the blockchain
        - advantages:
          - require less space
          - can operate in mobile phones
    - Hardware wallets
      - safer
      - costly
      - not smart contracts not coins
  - Transaction fees and GAS
    - Gas = Miner's fee
    - Gas <-> hours of labour to run a contract
    - standard price of gas = 20 gigawei(Gwei) = 10^-9 ETH
    - gas price fluctuates based on demand
    - gas limit
      - max gas to be used
    - gas issues
      - full amount to be paid beforehand
      - if we overpay: we get refund of amount unused
      - if we underpay: contract stops and no refund is made
      - not enough gas for running code: transaction ignored - no miner will pick it up
      - low gas bid: transaction may be delayed because miners will priotise high paid bids
    - Eth fees
      - gas used*gas bid(price) <-> hours of labor*wage per hour
