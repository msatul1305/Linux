Azure Cloud

1. Why Cloud?
   1. High availability
   2. Reliability(Fault Tolerance/Disaster Recover) - Resilience -> Deployed in multiple locations, Load balancing.
   3. Scalability - Adding more resources as need. Scaling out = Adding more resources. Scale up/down - make current resources bigger/smaller.
   4. Predictability - performance and cost. Auto-scaling, load balancing.
   5. Security - Full control - Patching, Maintenance, Network traffic control.
   6. Governance - Regulatory, Auditory requirements.
   7. Manageability - 
      Management of the cloud
       - AutoScaling
       - Monitoring
       - Template-based deployments
      Management in the cloud
       - Portal
       - CLI
       - APIs

2. CLI
   1. az create vm - To create a new VM 


1. Using PowerShell
Cmdlet - Small lightweight commands/scripts used to do some specific functions/tasks.
   1. New-AzVm - To create a new VM

2. ARM - Azure Resource manager
ARM Benefits
    - Group resource handling: deploy, manage and monitor resources as a group.
    - Consistency: consistent result of deployment.
    - Dependencies: define independency.
    - Access Control: built-in user right control.
    - Tagging: tag resources
    - Billing: bill for group of resources with similar tag.

3. Cloud Computing - On demand availability of computer resources split into 3 main categories:
    1. Compute
    2. Networking
    3. Storage

4. Cloud Economics - pricing
    Return on Investments(ROI)
    1. Capital Expenditure(Capex) - Fixed assets like land, building, equipment.
    2. Operational Expenditure(Opex) - ongoing day-to-day costs, annual costs.
    - Hourly pricing
    - consumption
        - per execution of function
        - per second
        - Combination

5. As a Service
 - On-Premises - Old practice where company own the hardware. 
 - IaaS - Infrastructure as a service: Provides Servers, Storages, Networking.
   - actual servers, scaling is fast, no ownership of hardware.
   - Lift and shift
   - pay as you use
 - PaaS - Platform as a service
   - IaaS + Middleware + Tools like data-warehouses, Database, API etc. e.g. Azure SQL database
   - pay as you use
 - SaaS - Software as a service
   - IaaS + PaaS + Software - eg. Gmail for email, Tally for accounting, Office 365, Azure SQL server, Azure active directory
   - pay based on monthly/yearly subscription
 - Serverless - Extreme PaaS
    - You don't have to manage any servers.
    - you are effectively using someone's server to run on. 
    - e.g. Azure functions
    - Azure functions -> Completely extracting away the server in such a way that single functon of code can be
    hosted, deployed, run and managed without having to maintain full application.

1. Identifying Cloud Service Models - IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS
    - IaaS: Org have complete control of infrastructure. e.g. VM, VNet, Storage
    - PaaS: Virtualized resources can cbe scaled up or down. e.g. App Services, Azure CDN, Cosmos DB
    - Saas: Remote server central location - e.g. Microsoft 365


1. Types of Cloud
    - Private - Similar to on premise where owning team is responsible for staffing, maintenance.
    - Public - Accessible anywhere across the globe. e.g. Azure, AWS, GCP.
    - Hybrid - Public + Private - For regulatory reasons.

2. Scale set
   - set of identical VMs.
   - Activated and deactivated as needed. - auto-scalability and load balancing. 
   - e.g. if VM1 takes up 90% ram, VM2 comes up automatically and now both have 45% utilisation.

3. App services
   - PaaS offering in Azure.
   - e.g. web apps - to host websites and web apps.
   - Web apps for containers
   - Api Apps.

4. Kubernetes(K8s)
   - Open Source container/Orchestration system - By Google
   - Orchestration makes sure that containers are configured correctly to work together.
   - For Automation of app deployment, Scaling and Management.
   - Pods and clusters
   - A no. of pods make a cluster.

5. Advantages of Containerization using Kubernetes/Docker
   - Managed Application Dependencies: dependencies included in container
   - Less Overhead: in compare to VM.
   - Increased Portability: can be deployed and used in any OS/Hardware.
   - Efficiency: Scaling and patching.
   - Consistency: always same.

6. Azure container registry(ACR) - keeps track of all containers
   - Serverless and Functions
   - Networking
     - Virtual Network: (VNet) -> eg. 172.169.2.0 to 172.169.2.255
         - Subnets: eg. 172.169.2.0 to 172.169.2.100 etc. 
       - Helps in - 
         -  Resource grouping: group together resources on same subnet.
         - Address allocation: efficiently allocate address.
         - Subnet security: secure group of resources together.
         - Scaling: adding more VNets or address if required
         - High availability: using load balancer, using VPN gateway to increase availability.
         - Isolation
     - Load Balancer
       - Inbound traffic from user sends data to -> Load balancer[Frontend] sends data to -> actual VM(VM1 vs VM2)[called 
         backend pool] sends data back to -> load balancer.  
       - Scenarios where load balancing is used:
         - Internet traffic management
         - Internal network traffic
         - port forwarding(Traffic forwarding to applications running on specific ports).
         - Outbound traffic
     - VPN gateway: for Hybrid cloud architecture. [VNet Gateways + VPN = VPN gateways]
       - used to send data/communicate from VM to on-premise server via public internet.
       - Gateway sits between VM and on-premise server.
         - Components of VPN gateway:
           - Its own public IP address.
           - Tunnel: secure connection with an encryption algorithm via which data will flow/communication will be made.
           - On-premise network with a complementary gateway to receive the data. -> called [Site-to-Site connection]
           - [Multisite connection]: 1 vpn gateway connecting to >1 on-premise network connecting to it.
     - Application gateway
       - Load balancer + cloud = app gateway
       - http requests can be routed based on URI paths(URL) or host headers - header of the segment/packet sent with the 
       request.
         - Benefits of application gateway:
           - Scaling
           - Encryption
           - Zone redundancy: span multiple availability zones and improve fault resilience.
           - Multi-site hosting: use same application gateway for up to 100 websites.
     - CDN: Content Delivery Network
       - CDN keeps a copy of websites and routes each user's request to the nearest location(called edge nodes).
       - It updates th web data using caching and data invalidation.  i.e. each data has expiry - data is copied from 
         master again on expiry/if data has changed.
       - Benefits:
         - Better performance
         - Scaling
         - Distribution
     - ExpressRoute
       - Superfast private connection to Azure
       - For companies with hybrid on-premise and Azure connection. 
       - Private, secure, low-latency connection
       - Don't go over internet.

7. IPv4
   - CIDR notation: 10.0.0.0/16 means it will create 2^16 addresses:
       - i.e. 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255
   - subnet mask:
       - 10.0.0.0/24 will give us 2^8 = 256 addresses.


1. Storage on Azure: Storage account = Unique Azure Namespace - each storage has its own web address. e.g. acloudguru.Azure.com

                   - no protection against region wide outage
                   - hazards: massive natural disaster, internet outage/ban in area.
                   - not supported in all regions
                     - the region must have 3 separate data centers for these kind of redundancy
           - Multiple region
           - Note: read and write possible only from primary region(for GRS and GZRS)
           - secondary region used for data backup, fail over is used to recover data(secondary becomes primary)
           - fail-over takes about an hour
           - To be able to always read from secondary region, use RA-GRS or RA-GZRS.
             - GRS: Geo-redundant storage
                 - 3 copies in primary regional physical location(LRS) - (Chennai-east)
                 - 3 copies in secondary(paired) regional physical location(LRS) - (Mumbai-east)
                 - protects against primary region failure but no primary zone redundancy.
             - RA-GRS(Read-access geo-redundant storage)
               - can read data from secondary as well
               - to use secondary, add -secondary to url:
                 - e.g. https://<storageaccname>-secondary.blob.core.windows.net
             - GZRS: Geo-Zone-redundant storage
                 - 3 copies in primary regional physical location(ZRS) - (Chennai-east, west, north)
                 - async 3 copies in secondary(paired) regional physical location(LRS) - (Mumbai-east)
                 - protects against primary region failure but no primary zone redundancy.

3. Authentication and Authorization
   - Identity Services
     - Authorization vs Authentication
     - Authorization
       - Making sure you are you
       - Confirming Identity
       - First test for access
     - Authentication
       - Comes after Authorization
       - Gives access to services/data/Applications etc.
       - Granular control of Identity services.
   - Azure Active Directory(AAD) - Central component for identity services on Azure.
     - AAD not same as traditional Active Directory(AD).
     - Used to manage users and permissions
     - First user: Every Azure account needs a first user(Initial AAD instance)
     - Tenant = Organization
       - Single instance of AAD.
       - represents the organization.
       - dedicated instance of AAD
       - distinct and separate
       - max 500 tenants: Each user can be a member or guest of up to 500 Azure AD tenants.
   - Zero Trust Concepts
     - Classic Trusted Model(Trusted locations)
       - Eg. Corporate Intranet/Network
       - Restrict private access to secure networks
     - Challenges to classic trusted model
       - user must be within corporate network
       - Remote work is a challenge
       - VPN can be used, but it is just the extension of trusted perimeter/network.
       - Mobile devices access is more challenging: need to load VPN client in mobile device.
       - One user from inside the perimeter network get malware which can be spread across the network
         - due to too broad of scope of access to some trusted devices
       - Zero trust model/Untrusted model(Trusted Identities, Not Location)
         - assumes everyone is untrustworthy regardless of user is inside or from outside network.
         - Trust is proven by identity instead of location/security perimeter.
         - least privilege access: just enough permissions to perform job
         - simplified, centralized management.
         - Allow access from approved devices only (regardless of location).
   - Multi-Factor Authentication - More Security but less convenient(more steps to log in)
     - At-least 2 ways to prove identity.
     - Methods:
       - Something you know: username, password.
       - Something you have: App like token/RSA/key fob, OTP.
       - Something you are: Fingerprint, face/retina scan/Biometrics.
   - Conditional Access
     - premium feature in AAD.
     - username password + if-then policies to grant access to specific applications.
     - paired with MFA(Multi-Factor access)
     - Use cases:
       - Enforce MFA for all administrators/users.
       - Block sign-ins from legacy authentication protocols.
       - Grant access to only specific locations.
       - require organization-managed devices for application sign-in.
   - Password-less Authentication
     - Increase convenience along with staying secure.
     - No need of password
     - Own device identified as secure
     - e.g. Microsoft authenticator app, Windows hello(Face recognition), FIDO security key(Hardware key - e.g. Smart Cards)
   - External Guest Access
     - Create separate organization account for external user: requires user to use 2 accounts(one primary and other from us).
     - Invite guest user to Azure
       - using existing account to log in. (Identity providers account invite)
         - from identity providers like Microsoft, Google or Facebook.
         - Other external identity providers.
         - Assigning permissions for guest account.
         - Require MFA and approved/managed devices only.
   - Azure Active Directory Domain Services(AADDS)
     - Limitations of ADs
       - Legacy applications can't use modern auth protocols like OAuth2.0
       - Requires traditional ADDS(Active Directory Domain Services) like:
         - Group Policy
         - LDAP
         - NTLM
         - Kerberos
       - Solution:
         - Sync to Azure Ad from on-premise AD using Azure AD Connect
         - Configure another AD server on Azure VM instead of on-premise
           - Also called self-managed ADDS.
         - AADDS
           - Provides AADS by default in Azure.
           - Provides support to legacy ADs like Group Policy, LDAP, NTLM, Kerberos
           - Complete unique namespace/domain name is created. e.g. aadds-companyname.com
           - one-way ot bidirectional sync of user groups and credentials from Azure ADs to Azure ADDS.
   - Single Sign-On(SSO)
     - One pair of credentials for multiple services
     - For e.g. using google account to log in to microsoft.

        - Data: Authorized and encrypted access.
    - Security Network Connectivity
      - Azure firewall
        - rules to allow/deny traffic on network
        - Software and hardware variations
        - critical part
      - DDoS(Distributed denial of service) - many computers targeting single server/website to make it stop.
        - 2012: 6 US banks flooded with 60Gbs of data per second - BOA, JPMC, US bank corp, Citi, PNC bank.
        - 2014: Cloudflare slammed 400Gbps traffic
        - 2018, Feb 28: 1.35TBps/127M requests per sec GitHub DDos attack.
        - Solution by Azure:
          - Network Security Group(NSG)
            - Resource Firewall
              - personal firewalls for resources(virtual network, subnet or network interface)
            - Rules
              - set of rules for who and what can access any resource attached to NSG.
            - Application Security Group(ASG): for individual applications.
    - Public and private endpoints
      - to secure Azure Publicly reachable/exposed PaaS services like Azure storage, Azure SQL etc.
      - When accessing these public services over a virtual network via a VM, traffic from virtual network travels 
        - via internet to the virtual service like Azure storage.
      - Also, these managed service endpoints are by default public end points. (Contents of resources are not accessible for public though).
      - Solution:
        - Service endpoints(Good Solution):
          - Allows to privately connect a virtual network subnet to different Azure PaaS services.
          - i.e. it enables a direct connection from subnet to managed service.
          - so, resources inside of that subnet like VMs will connect over Microsoft's private backbone from subnet 
            - to the managed service instead of traversing via public internet.
          - Option to configure the managed service e.g. Azure Storage to only allow traffic from that service endpoint enabled subnet to that service
            - Cutting access off to everywhere else
          - Option to restrict access to specific public IP addresses. 
          - Limitations of service endpoints:
            - provides secure access to only Azure Virtual Networks and not for Non-Azure or on-Premise locations
            - must allow on-premise access via public IP
            - i.e. PaaS public end point still exists and hence, it is not truly private.
            - It provides private access to the entire Azure storage and not just an instance of it.
        - Private endpoints(Better Solution):
          - Managed network interface
            - Provides connection to ***specific instance*** of a service.
            - e.g. single storage account, SQL instance, etc.
          - Truly private connection
            - Available over other connected networks like:
              - Hybrid/on-premise networks connected to Azure virtual network connected over VPN and express route
            - Also provides add-on private connectivity to other virtual peered with original virtual network
              - i.e. Azure virtual network can share its private connectivity over a private endpoint with other networks connected to it as well.
                - Regardless of if the connection is on-premise, VPN or peered connection.
              - Provision to completely disable public access to out connected service. i.e. public endpoint disabled.
            - use case example
              - VPN connection from home office to Azure VNet
                - need to access sensitive Azure SQL db from home office
                - need to disable public internet exposure.

10. Testing strategies for your application
    - Automated Testing: to make sure that they're executed
      - Unit Testing
        - run by each new version of code that's committed into your version-control system.
        - ideally cover 100% of the code
        - quick (typically under 30 seconds)
        - should be applied both to application code and infrastructure code.
      - Smoke Testing
        - more exhaustive than unit tests
        - but still not as much as integration tests.
        - run in less than 15 minutes.
        - verify that each component can be correctly built, and each component meets your criteria for expected functionality and performance.
        - usually involve building the application code.
      - Integration Testing
        - determines whether your components can interact with each other as they should
        - usually take longer than smoke testing, and consequently they're sometimes executed less frequently.
        - For example, running integration tests every night still offers a good compromise
    - Manual Testing: much more expensive and used less frequently than automated testing
      - to correct errors before they become too expensive to repair, or before they cause customer dissatisfaction.
      - Types:
        - Acceptance Testing: confirming that the application is doing what it should.
          - Blue/Green deployments: 
            - when deploying a new application version, you can deploy it in parallel to the existing one.
            - you can start redirecting your clients to the new version.
            - If everything goes well, you'll decommission the old version.
            - If there's any problem with the new deployment, you can always redirect your clients back to the older deployment.
          - Canary releases:
            - you can expose new functionality of your application (ideally using feature flags) to a select group of users.
          - A/B testing:
            - similar to canary release testing, but while canary releases focus on mitigating risk, 
            - A/B testing focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of two similar ways of achieving the same goal.
            - For example, if you have two versions of the layout of a certain area of your application, you could send half of your users to one version and the other half your users to the other, 
            - then you could use some metrics to see which layout works better for your application goals.
        - Stress tests
          - to be confident that your application and infrastructure will scale automatically to meet the increased demand.
          - critical that you monitor all the components of the system in order to identify whether there are any scale limitations.
          - Every component of the system that's not able to scale out can turn into a bottleneck (such as active/passive network components or databases).
          - verify that after the stress test is concluded, your infrastructure scales back down to its normal condition in order to keep your costs under control.
        - Fault injection
          - Your application should be resilient to infrastructure failures,
          - introducing faults in the underlying infrastructure and observing how your application behaves is fundamental for increasing the trust in your redundancy mechanisms.
          - example: ungracefully shutting down infrastructure components, degrading the performance of certain elements such as network equipment, or purposely introducing faults in the environment are ways of verifying that your application is going to continue to behave or react as expected, should these situations ever occur in real life.
          - Chaos engineering: identify areas where faults may occur by purposefully making key pieces of infrastructure unavailable.
        - Security tests
          - routinely testing your application for security vulnerabilities.
          - cross-site scripting or SQL injection.
          - red team exercises: where security teams attempt to compromise your application.

11. Performance efficiency
    - scaling up(Vertical scaling): increase the capacity of a given instance. For example, to increase your processing capacity, you might increase a virtual machine from 1 vCPU and 3.5 GB of RAM to 2 vCPUs and 7 GB of RAM.
    - scaling down: decrease the capacity of a given instance. For example, you might decrease a virtual machine's capacity from 2 vCPUs and 7 GB of RAM to 1 vCPU and 3.5 GB of RAM.
    - scaling out(Horizontal scaling): process of adding more instances to support the load of your solution. For example, if your website front ends were hosted on virtual machines, you could increase the number of virtual machines if the level of load increased.
    - scaling in: process of removing instances that are no longer needed to support the load of your solution.
    - Autoscale
      - set a minimum and maximum threshold of instances.
      - scale based on specific metrics, like queue length or CPU utilization.
      - scale based on schedules. e.g. weekdays between 5:00 PM and 7:00 PM.
    - Throttling
      - limit the number of requests from a source.
      - to prevent the application from breaking.
      - most frequently used in applications that expose API endpoints.
      - limit the number of requests per user to 100 per minute.
      - If any single customer exceeded this limit, you could respond with an HTTP 429 status code and include the wait time before another request can successfully be submitted.
    - Optimize storage performance
      - Optimize virtual machine storage performance
      - SSD vs HDD 
      - Premium vs standard etc.
      - Optimize storage performance for your application
        - Caching
          - A cache typically stores data in memory and allows for fast retrieval.
          - This data can be frequently accessed data, data that you specify from a database, or temporary data such as user state.
          - By collocating this cache in the same region as your application and database, you reduce the overall latency between the two.
          - Azure Cache for Redis is a caching service on Azure that stores data in memory. It's based on the open-source Redis cache and is a fully managed service offering by Microsoft. You'll select the performance tier that you require, then you'll configure your application to use the service.
        - Polyglot persistence
          - use of different data storage technologies to handle your storage requirements.
            - Suppose that you store application assets in a blob store, 
            - product reviews and recommendations in a NoSQL store, and 
            - user profile or account data in a SQL database.
