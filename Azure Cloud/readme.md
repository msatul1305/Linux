Azure Cloud

1. Why Cloud?
   1. High availability
   2. Reliability(Fault Tolerance/Disaster Recover) - Resilience -> Deployed in multiple locations, Load balancing.
   3. Scalability - Adding more resources as need. Scaling out = Adding more resources. Scale up/down - make current resources bigger/smaller.
   4. Predictability - performance and cost. Auto-scaling, load balancing.
   5. Security - Full control - Patching, Maintenance, Network traffic control.
   6. Governance - Regulatory, Auditory requirements.
   7. Manageability - 
      Management of the cloud
       - AutoScaling
       - Monitoring
       - Template-based deployments
      Management in the cloud
       - Portal
       - CLI
       - APIs

2. CLI
   1. az create vm - To create a new VM 


1. Using PowerShell
Cmdlet - Small lightweight commands/scripts used to do some specific functions/tasks.
   1. New-AzVm - To create a new VM

2. ARM - Azure Resource manager
ARM Benefits
    - Group resource handling: deploy, manage and monitor resources as a group.
    - Consistency: consistent result of deployment.
    - Dependencies: define independency.
    - Access Control: built-in user right control.
    - Tagging: tag resources
    - Billing: bill for group of resources with similar tag.

3. Cloud Computing - On demand availability of computer resources split into 3 main categories:
    1. Compute
    2. Networking
    3. Storage

4. Cloud Economics - pricing
    Return on Investments(ROI)
    1. Capital Expenditure(Capex) - Fixed assets like land, building, equipment.
    2. Operational Expenditure(Opex) - ongoing day-to-day costs, annual costs.
    - Hourly pricing
    - consumption
        - per execution of function
        - per second
        - Combination

5. As a Service
 - On-Premises - Old practice where company own the hardware. 
 - IaaS - Infrastructure as a service: Provides Servers, Storages, Networking.
   - actual servers, scaling is fast, no ownership of hardware.
   - Lift and shift
   - pay as you use
 - PaaS - Platform as a service
   - IaaS + Middleware + Tools like data-warehouses, Database, API etc. e.g. Azure SQL database
   - pay as you use
 - SaaS - Software as a service
   - IaaS + PaaS + Software - eg. Gmail for email, Tally for accounting, Office 365, Azure SQL server, Azure active directory
   - pay based on monthly/yearly subscription
 - Serverless - Extreme PaaS
    - You don't have to manage any servers.
    - you are effecively using someone's server to run on. 
    - e.g. Azure functions
    - Azure functions -> Completely extracting away the server in such a way that single functon of code can be
    hosted, deployed, run and managed without having to maintain full application.

1. Identifying Cloud Service Models - IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS
    - IaaS: Org have complete control of infrastructure. e.g. VM, VNet, Storage
    - PaaS: Virtualized resources can cbe scaled up or down. e.g. App Services, Azure CDN, Cosmos DB
    - Saas: Remote server central location - e.g. Microsoft 365


1. Types of Cloud
    - Private - Similar to on premise where owning team is responsible for staffing, maintenance.
    - Public - Accessible anywhere across the globe. e.g. Azure, AWS, GCP.
    - Hybrid - Public + Private - For regulatory reasons.

2. Scale set
   - set of identical VMs.
   - Activated and deactivated as needed. - auto-scalability and load balancing. 
   - e.g. if VM1 takes up 90% ram, VM2 comes up automatically and now both have 45% utilisation.

3. App services
   - PaaS offering in Azure.
   - e.g. web apps - to host websites and web apps.
   - Web apps for containers
   - Api Apps.

4. Kubernetes(K8s)
   - Open Source container/Orchestration system - By Google
   - Orchestration makes sure that containers are configured correctly to work together.
   - For Automation of app deployment, Scaling and Management.
   - Pods and clusters
   - A no. of pods make a cluster.

5. Advantages of Containerization using Kubernetes/Docker
   - Managed Application Dependencies: dependencies included in container
   - Less Overhead: in compare to VM.
   - Increased Portability: can be deployed and used in any OS/Hardware.
   - Efficiency: Scaling and patching.
   - Consistency: always same.

6. Azure container registry(ACR) - keeps track of all containers
   - Serverless and Functions
   - Networking
     - Virtual Network: (VNet) -> eg. 172.169.2.0 to 172.169.2.255
         - Subnets: eg. 172.169.2.0 to 172.169.2.100 etc. 
       - Helps in - 
         -  Resource grouping: group together resources on same subnet.
         - Address allocation: efficiently allocate address.
         - Subnet security: secure group of resources together.
         - Scaling: adding more VNets or address if required
         - High availability: using load balancer, using VPN gateway to increase availability.
         - Isolation
     - Load Balancer
       - Inbound traffic from user sends data to -> Load balancer[Frontend] sends data to -> actual VM(VM1 vs VM2)[called 
         backend pool] sends data back to -> load balancer.  
       - Scenarios where load balancing is used:
         - Internet traffic management
         - Internal network traffic
         - port forwarding(Traffic forwarding to applications running on specific ports).
         - Outbound traffic
     - VPN gateway: for Hybrid cloud architecture. [VNet Gateways + VPN = VPN gateways]
       - used to send data/communicate from VM to on-premise server via public internet.
       - Gateway sits between VM and on-premise server.
         - Components of VPN gateway:
           - Its own public IP address.
           - Tunnel: secure connection with an encryption algorithm via which data will flow/communication will be made.
           - On-premise network with a complementary gateway to receive the data. -> called [Site-to-Site connection]
           - [Multisite connection]: 1 vpn gateway connecting to >1 on-premise network connecting to it.
     - Application gateway
       - Load balancer + cloud = app gateway
       - http requests can be routed based on URI paths(URL) or host headers - header of the segment/packet sent with the 
       request.
         - Benefits of application gateway:
           - Scaling
           - Encryption
           - Zone redundancy: span multiple availability zones and improve fault resilience.
           - Multi-site hosting: use same application gateway for up to 100 websites.
     - CDN: Content Delivery Network
       - CDN keeps a copy of websites and routes each user's request to the nearest location(called edge nodes).
       - It updates th web data using caching and data invalidation.  i.e. each data has expiry - data is copied from 
         master again on expiry/if data has changed.
       - Benefits:
         - Better performance
         - Scaling
         - Distribution
     - ExpressRoute
       - Superfast private connection to Azure
       - For companies with hybrid on-premise and Azure connection. 
       - Private, secure, low-latency connection
       - Don't go over internet.

7. IPv4
   - CIDR notation: 10.0.0.0/16 means it will create 2^16 addresses:
       - i.e. 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255
   - subnet mask:
       - 10.0.0.0/24 will give us 2^8 = 256 addresses.

       - First test for access
     - Authentication
       - Comes after Authorization
       - Gives access to services/data/Applications etc.
       - Granular control of Identity services.
   - Azure Active Directory(AAD) - Central component for identity services on Azure.
     - AAD not same as traditional Active Directory(AD).
     - Used to manage users and permissions
     - First user: Every Azure account needs a first user(Initial AAD instance)
     - Tenant = Organization
       - Single instance of AAD.
       - represents the organization.
       - dedicated instance of AAD
       - distinct and separate
       - max 500 tenants: Each user can be a member or guest of up to 500 Azure AD tenants.
   - Zero Trust Concepts
     - Classic Trusted Model(Trusted locations)
       - Eg. Corporate Intranet/Network
       - Restrict private access to secure networks
     - Challenges to classic trusted model
       - user must be within corporate network
       - Remote work is a challenge
       - VPN can be used, but it is just the extension of trusted perimeter/network.
       - Mobile devices access is more challenging: need to load VPN client in mobile device.
       - One user from inside the perimter network get malware which can be spread across the network
         - due to too broad of scope of acess to some trusted devices
       - Zero trust model/Untrusted model(Trusted Identities, Not Location)
         - assumes everyone is untrustworthy regardless of user is inside or from outside network.
         - Trust is proven by identity instead of location/security perimeter.
         - least previlage access: just enough permissions to perform job
         - simplified, centralized management.
         - Allow access from approved devices only (regardless of location).
   - Multi-Factor Authentication - More Security but less convenient(more steps to log in)
     - At-least 2 ways to prove identity.
     - Methods:
       - Something you know: username, password.
       - Something you have: App like token/RSA/key fob, OTP.
       - Something you are: Fingerprint, face/retina scan/Biometrics.
   - Conditional Access
     - premium feature in AAD.
     - username password + if-then policies to grant access to specific applications.
     - paired with MFA(Multi-Factor access)
     - Use cases:
       - Enforce MFA for all administrators/users.
       - Block sign-ins from legacy authentication protocols.
       - Grant access to only specific locations.
       - require organization-managed devices for application sign-in.
   - Passwordless Authentication
     - Increase convenience along with staying secure.
     - No need of password
     - Own device identified as secure
     - e.g. Microsoft authenticator app, Windows hello(Face recognition), FIDO security key(Hardware key - e.g. Smart Cards)
   - External Guest Access
     - Create separate organization account for external user: requires user to use 2 accounts(one primary and other from us).
     - Invite guest user to Azure
       - using existing account to log in. (Identity providers account invite)
         - from identity providers like Microsoft, Google or Facebook.
         - Other external identity providers.
         - Assigning permissions for guest account.
         - Require MFA and approved/managed devices only.
   - Azure Active Directory Domain Services(AADDS)
     - Limitations of ADs
       - Legacy applications can't use modern auth protocols like OAuth2.0
       - Requires traditional ADDS(Active Directory Domain Services) like:
         - Group Policy
         - LDAP
         - NTLM
         - Kerberos
       - Solution:
         - Sync to Azure Ad from on-premise AD using Azure AD Connect
         - Configure another AD server on Azure VM instead of on-premise
           - Also called self-managed ADDS.

        - Solution by Azure:
          - Network Security Group(NSG)
            - Resource Firewall
              - personal firewalls for resources(virtual network, subnet or network interface)
            - Rules
              - set of rules for who and what can access any resource attached to NSG.
            - Application Security Group(ASG): for individual applications.
    - Public and private endpoints
      - to secure Azure Publicly reachable/exposed PaaS services like Azure storage, Azure SQL etc.
      - When accessing these public services over a virtual network via a VM, traffic from virtual network travels 
        - via internet to the virtual service like Azure storage.
      - Also, these managed service endpoints are by default public end points. (Contents of resources are not accessible for public though).
      - Solution:
        - Service endpoints(Good Solution):
          - Allows to privately connect a virtual network subnet to different Azure PaaS services.
          - i.e. it enables a direct connection from subnet to managed service.
          - so, resources inside of that subnet like VMs will connect over Microsoft's private backbone from subnet 
            - to the managed service instead of traversing via public internet.
          - Option to configure the managed service e.g. Azure Storage to only allow traffic from that service endpoint enabled subnet to that service
            - Cutting access off to everywhere else
          - Option to restrict access to specific public IP addresses. 
          - Limitations of service endpoints:
            - provides secure access to only Azure Virtual Networks and not for Non-Azure or on-Premise locations
            - must allow on-premise access via public IP
            - i.e. PaaS public end point still exists and hence, it is not truly private.
            - It provides private access to the entire Azure storage and not just an instance of it.
        - Private endpoints(Better Solution):
          - Managed network interface
            - Provides connection to ***specific instance*** of a service.
            - e.g. single storage account, SQL instance, etc.
          - Truly private connection
            - Available over other connected networks like:
              - Hybrid/on-premise networks connected to Azure virtual network connected over VPN and express route
            - Also provides add-on private connectivity to other virtual peered with original virtual network
              - i.e. Azure virtual network can share its private connectivity over a private endpoint with other networks connected to it as well.
                - Regardless of if the connection is on-premise, VPN or peered connection.
              - Provision to completely disable public access to out connected service. i.e. public endpoint disabled.
            - use case example
              - VPN connection from home office to Azure VNet
                - need to access sensitive Azure SQL db from home office
                - need to disable public internet exposure.
