- Azure Functions
  - serverless application platform: abstract servers
  - run functions(small pieces of code) in cloud
  - FaaS: Function as a Service
  - Choice of programming languages: C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, PowerShell etc.
  - Hosting choices: Service plan on Azure App Service
    - Consumption plan:
      - Serverless pricing
      - bills only when functions are running
      - automatic scaling
      - Time limit for each function invocation: 5 min
    - App Service plan:
      - Traditional pricing model: monthly bills
      - No time limit
    - Premium plan:
      - Faster
      - Secure
      - reserved instances
      - Serverless automatic scaling
    - Run Azure Functions on:
      - Docker Container
        - On-premise or on cloud
      - Locally
  - Development Environment choices: Azure portal, Visual Studio(c#), Azure Functions Core Tools(CLI, VS code)
- Implement Azure Functions Skills
  - Implement function triggers by using data operations, timers and webhooks
  - Implement input and output bindings for a function
  - Implement Azure Durable Functions
- Create Azure function in Azure portal app
  - Create a resource -> function app -> deploy function app
  - Open deployment -> Go to functions  -> create
- Azure function triggers
  - HTTP request Trigger(webhooks): runs in response to a web request. - use for APIs and webhooks
    - trigger based on HTTP methods - e.g. GET, POST
    - trigger based on Route/URL
    - secured via authorization key
      - Anonymous: no keyt required
      - Function: key per function
      - Admin: key per function app
    - Create HTTP function trigger
      - open function app -> create function
      - [see create_functions.sh file for further detail.](create_functions.sh)
  - Timer Trigger(scheduled tasks): create scheduled tasks(e.g. at 12 am every night)
    - run scheduled tasks in the cloud.
    - 
  - Queue Trigger - run in response to a message on a queue
  - Cosmos DB Trigger - run when a document is created or updated in cosmos db storage
  - Blob Storage Trigger(data operation) - run when a new file is uploaded to blob storage.
  - Other triggers:
    - Event grid
    - Microsoft Graph
