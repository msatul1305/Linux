- Azure Cosmos DB Storage
  - Database types
    - Relational databases
      - SQL Server, MySQL, Postgres etc.
      - low scalability with high amount of data like IOT and social media
      - fixed schema
      - table based structure
      - vertical scaling
      - ACID guarantees(atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability)
      - Data normalization: no repetition of data: 1nf, 2nf 3nf, 4nf
    - NoSQL
      - distributed in nature
      - Fluid schema
      - Multiple structures
        - Key-value stores
        - graph databases
          - used in 
            - product recommendation engines
            - social network relationship mapping
        - document stores
        - wide-column(2-d key value store)
      - Horizontal scaling is possible using data partitioning
      - provides BASE(basically available, Soft state, eventual consistency) semantics
        - data is distributed
        - hence, first data is distributed to current node and then to all other nodes i.e. soft state
        - soft state: we don't know if the data is most recent or waiting to be updated 
      - Non-normalized data: data is not optimized based on how its stored and to prevent repeating.
        - Data is optimized based on how we read it
  - COSMOS DB
    - globally distributed, multi-model db service
    - extremely low latency(single digit millisecond)
    - provides SLA for throughput, latency, availability, and consistency.
    - supports multi-region replication at any point
    - provides five-nines of high-availability for both reads and writes(99.999% availability)
    - Enables elastic scalability
    - pricing is based on throughput provisioned
    - supports multiple consistency options
    - Features
      - Integrated Analytics
        - Spark
      - Region Support
      - Schema-agnostic
        - property of a database of mapping a query issued with the user terminology and structure, automatically mapping it to the dataset vocabulary.
      - Automatic Indexing(built-in)
      - Supports multiple SDKs
      - Organization of data example:
        1. Cosmos DB account(SQL api)
        2. Database(App1)
           2.1. Container1
              2.1.1. Item1
              2.1.2. Item2
           2.2. Container2
        3. Database(App2)
  - Creating cosmos DB containers
    - Select appropriate API and SDK for a solution
      - Selecting API:
        - Cosmos DB can act like multiple types of databases
        - Supported APIs:
          - SQL
            - Structured Query langugae
            - JSON documents also supported
            - Database Entity: Database
            - Container Entity: Container
          - Cassandra
            - CQL(Cassandra Query Language)
            - wide-column format(2-d key-value store)
            - Database Entity: Keyspace
            - Container Entity: Table
          - MongoDB
            - JSON document store
            - Database Entity: Database
            - Container Entity: Collection
          - Gremlin
            - graph db
            - relationship between data is visible
            - product recommendation engines, social networks, etc.
            - Apache Tinkerpop's Gremlin language for querying relationships
            - Database Entity: Database
            - Container Entity: Graph
          - Azure Table
            - part of Azure Storage
            - querying data using OData or LINQ queries
            - Database Entity: Not Applicable
            - Container Entity: Table
        - Supported SDKs
          - for SQL API
            - Cosmos DB SDK
          - for MongoDB, Cassandra Gremlin
            - use current SDks for the API
          - For Azure Table API
            - use current Table Storage SDK
    - Process of creating cosmos DB container
      - Using portal
      - using CLI: [create_container.sh](create_container.sh)
    - Perform operations on data and cosmos DB containers
    - Set appropriate consistency level for operations
    - Implement partitioning schemes and partition keys
    - Manage change feed notifications and server side execution
