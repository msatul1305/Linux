- Azure API Management
  - [solution_architecture](solution_architecture.png)
  - Azure service to create consistent, modern API gateways for existing back-end services.
  - provides secure, scalable API Access for applications.
  - How to design API integration in Azure
  - Components of Azure API Management Service in Azure Cloud
    - Azure API Management structure and its components
      - 3 components
        - API gateway
          - sits between actual web api and client to provide layer of abstraction to user from actual api
          - accepts API calls from client
          - forwards/routes them back to backends(actual web api)
          - it also verifies API keys, JWT tokens, certificates, and other credentials.
          - enforces usage quotas and rate limits.
          - it also caches backend responses.
        - Azure Portal
          - administrative interface to set up API program
          - capabilities:
            - define or import API schema
            - set up policies like quotas or transformations on the APIs.
            - package APIs into products
            - Manage users that have access to APIs
        - Developer portal
          - web user interface to read API documentation
          - capabilities:
            - read API documentation
            - create account and subscribe to get API keys
            - try API via interactive console
            - access analytics
      - Versions and Revisions
        - Versions:
          - versions allow to present group of related APIs to developers.
          - e.g. 
            - https:API/v1
            - https:API/v2
        - Revisions:
          - Revisions allow to make changes to API in controlled and safe way, without disturbing the consumers.
          - e.g. https://api/all;rev=3
        - each version can have multiple revisions.(just like non-versioned API)
        - revisions can be used with or without versions.
        - versions are used to separate API versions with breaking changes while revisions are used for minor and non-breaking changes to an API.
    - Managing APIs with Products and Groups
      - Each API in Azure API Management contains reference to back-end service that implements API and its operations.
      - Operations in API management are highly configurable
        - control over:
          - URL mapping
          - query and path parameters
          - request and response content
          - operation response caching
          - rate limit quotas
          - API restrictions
      - API access
        - Products and Groups
          - Products
            - how API are surfaced to developers, have one or more APIs, title, description and terms of use.
            - can be open or protected
              - protected products must be subscribed to before they can be used.
              - developers have to first subscribe, get API key, then use key for API access.
              - if product is ready to use by developers, it can be published
              - subscription approval is configured at product level.
                - Devs need this sub to access products.
          - Groups
            - used to manage visibility of products to the developers
            - Administrators
              - manage API management service instances, creating APIs, operations and products.
            - Developers
              - devs are granted access to dev portal and build applications that call operations of an API
            - Guests
              - Unauthenticated dev portal users with read-only access like ability to view APIs but not call them.
            - Custom groups
              - created by Admin
              - in Azure Active Directory tenants
          - Devs can be created or invited to join by admins or can sign up themselves from dev portal
          - each dev can be a member of one or more group, can subscribe to products to that group
  - Create Azure API Management Instance
    - Configure Azure API Management in Azure Portal
    - Integrate existing API application with API Management
    - Setup access for developers
  - Protect API from unauthorized use
  - Implement policies like throttling, and caching
