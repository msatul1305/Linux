    - Queue vs Service bus
    - use Queue Storage if
        - storage needs > 80 GB
        - Logs needed for all transactions executed against the queue
        - need to track progress of message processing
    - use Service bus if:
        - need support for receiving messages without polling(with AMQP 1.0)
        - guarantee message ordering(FIFO)
        - detect duplicate messages
        - up to 256 KB size messages
        - support topic based notifications(one to many)
        - support publishing and consuming messages in batch
