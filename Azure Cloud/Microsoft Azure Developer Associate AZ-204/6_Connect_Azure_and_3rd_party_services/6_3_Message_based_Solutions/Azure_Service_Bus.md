- Azure Service Bus for Application Messaging
  - Fully-managed enterprise Message Broker Service
  - enables multiple nodes of messaging
  - with integration for common messaging systems
    - including Java Message Service(JMS).

  - Features of Azure Service Bus
    - Supports HTTP/HTTPS and AMQP(Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) protocols
    - Includes messages for both queues and topics
    - Supports 3 different performance tiers:
      - Basic
        - supports only queue(not topics)
      - Standard
        - recommended option
        - pay as you go
        - throughput and latency is variable
        - utilizes shared resources
        - provides automatic scaling
        - supports message up to 256 KB
        - does not support geo-disaster recovery or availability zones.
      - Premium
        - prod
        - redundancy 
        - disaster recovery
        - Fixed pricing based on messaging units 
        - Fixed throughput based on messaging units
        - utilizes dedicated resources
        - requires configuration of scaling rules
        - supports message up to 1 MB
        - does support geo-disaster recovery or availability zones.
    - Supports advanced configurability:
      - Message Ordering
        - process in order they were received
      - Batching
        - batch process multiple messages at one time
      - ***DLQ: Dead-letter Queue***
        - for both queue or topic 
        - helps capture messages that were not processed during their lifetime
        - and act accordingly with those messages
      - Duplicate detection
        - detect if the message is already being used by another process/consumer
  - Service Bus URL Structure
    - https://namespace.servicebus.windows.net/queue_or_topic_name
  - Message Ordering
    - FIFO order
    - uses sessions to maintain FIFO
    - supported in queues and topics
      - but must be enabled first
  - Scaling Azure Service Bus
    - standard tier namespaces support partitioning of queues and topics
    - partitioning is not supported in premium tier namespaces
    - partitioning enables separate messaging stores and brokers for a single entity
    - partitioning queues and topics can use a partition key to determine the partition.
    - without a partition key, round-robin algo is used by Azure.
