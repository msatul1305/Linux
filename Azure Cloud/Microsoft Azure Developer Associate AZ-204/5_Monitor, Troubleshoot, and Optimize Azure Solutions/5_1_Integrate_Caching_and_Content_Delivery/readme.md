- Configuring Cache and Expiration policies in Azure CDN
  - CDN: Content Delivery Network
    - Globally distributed network
    - Advantages of CDN
      - Geographically located servers to help deliver internet content faster to users
      - reduces asset load times, download and latency
      - help reduces bandwidth costs of hosting provider by reducing content amount for origin server to handle
      - increases availability and redundancy(create redundant copies all over the world)
        - helps in network failures
      - helps in protection from distributed denial-of-service(DDos) attacks
    - Content types
      - Static content
        - Image files
        - CSS files
        - JS files
      - Dynamic content
        - anything that changes on user interaction
          - Dashboard with graphs or tables
          - search queries
    - CDNs are used to deliver the ***static content***
    - ***Point of presence servers***: static servers which copy static files from main web server as local copy
    - Request-response lifecycle for CDN
      - Initially, all endpoints are empty
      - When a user requests for a webpage, it goes to origin server and stores local copy for next time
  - Caching
    - 
  - creating a new CDN for a web app(already deployed in Azure)
    - Portal -> create a resource -> web -> CDN
    - Portal -> open web app -> +Endpoint -> origin type: webapp
