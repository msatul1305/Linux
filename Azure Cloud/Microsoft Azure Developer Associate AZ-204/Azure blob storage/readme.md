- Azure blob storage
    - what is?
      - BLOB: Binary Large OBject
      - Object storage for cloud
        - Store unstructured data
          - Text files
            - .txt, .html, .json, .log
          - Binary files
            - Images, Videos
            - Zip files
            - PDFs
            - Virtual disks for VMs
        - Accessible via 
          - REST API over HTTP/HTTPS(recommended)
          - portal
          - CLI
          - Powershell
          - Azure Storage Client Library: for applications(uses REST API calls)
            - .NET, Java, Python, Node.js
    - Core concepts
        - Blob types
            - Block blob
                - Images, videos, text files or PDF documents
                - complete file/binary is replaced with new file
            - Append blob
                - log files
                - append is required at end of file
            - Page blob:
                - provides random read/write access
                - used for VHDs(Virtual disks)
      - Storage accounts
        - Data is always encrypted using storage service encryption(SSE)
        - Types
          - Storage V2(General purpose V2): default account
            - supports Blob, files, queues, table
            - blob supports block, append and page type blobs
            - high throughput, recommended option
            - Performance based
              - Standard performance
                - uses magnetic drives/HDD
              - Premium performance
                - uses SSDs
                - supports only blob storage: only page type of blob(block and append not supported)
                - not files, queues and table
                - i.e. only used as virtual hard disks(VHDs)
                - BlockBlobStorage account
                  - To use block storage with premium performance
                  - supports block and append blob types
                  - for a lot of transactions with small objects
                - File Storage account
                  - file service with premium performance
          - Storage(General purpose V1)
            - old/legacy
            - supports Blob, files, queues, table
          - BlobStorage
            - blob
            - old/legacy
      - Containers
      - Replication strategies
        - LRS
        - ZRS
        - GRS
        - RA-GRS
        - GZRS
        - RA-GZRS
    - Create storage account, container and blobs
      - create storage account
      - create blob container(for images and videos)
      - store blobs in blob container
      - via Portal
        - Storage accounts -> Blob service -> add container -> upload
    - Authorize Requests to blob storage
      - Shared key(Storage account key/access key) - used in connection strings
      - Shared Access Signatures(SAS) - tokens appended to blob URLs.
        - Portal -> storage account -> storage container/blob -> generate SAS token and URL
        - copy sas token and update URL-> https://storagename.net/path/file.jpg?Add_SAS_Token_here
      - Azure Active Directory
      - Anonymous public read access
        - Portal -> storage account -> storage container/blob -> change access level -> blob/container(url?comp=list will list all files in container)
    - Interact with data using appropriate SDK
      - .Net
    - Set and Retrieve properties and metadata
    - Implement data archiving and retention
      - Implement hot, cool and archive storage
    - Move items in blob storage between storage accounts or containers
