- .bashrc file 
  - script that Bash runs whenever it is started interactively. 
  - initializes an interactive shell session.
  - used to set up shell environment,
    - define aliases,
    - and customize your prompt.
  - Basic example of .bashrc file:
    - [bashrc_sample.sh](bashrc_sample.sh)
    - This file would do the following:
    - Set the prompt (PS1) to display the 
      - username (\u), 
      - hostname (\h),
      - and current working directory (\w), 
      - with colors for better readability. 
    - Define two aliases: ll to list all files (ls -alF) and 
      - cls to clear the screen (clear). 
    - Add the bin directory in your home folder to the PATH environment variable, 
      - allowing you to execute scripts and binaries stored there without specifying the full path.
