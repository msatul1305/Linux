# Node.js

- open-source
- cross-platform
- JavaScript runtime environment
- runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside the browser
- runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.
- provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking
- libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.
- When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem,
  - instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting,
  - Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.
- allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server
  - without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency,
  - which could be a significant source of bugs.

- Asynchronous Programming
  - The following concepts are also key to understand programming, which is one of the fundamental parts of Node.js:
    - Asynchronous programming and callbacks
    - Timers
    - Promises
    - Async and Await
    - Closures
    - The Event Loop
