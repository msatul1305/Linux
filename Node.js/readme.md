- Node.js
  - open-source
  - cross-platform
  - JavaScript runtime environment
  - runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside the browser
  - runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.
  - provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking
  - libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.
  - When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, 
    - instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, 
    - Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.
  - allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server 
    - without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, 
    - which could be a significant source of bugs.
