- Pandas is an open-source, Python-based library used in data manipulation applications requiring high performance. 
- The name is derived from “Panel Data” having multidimensional data. 
- This was developed in 2008 by Wes McKinney and was developed for data analysis.)
- Pandas are useful in performing 5 major steps of data analysis
  - Load the data, 
  - clean/manipulate it,
  - prepare it, 
  - model it, and 
  - analyze the data.
- pandas dataframe.
  - 2D mutable and tabular structure for representing data labelled with axes - rows and columns.
  - Syntax:
  ```import pandas as pd ```
  ```dataframe = pd.DataFrame( data, index, columns, dtype)```
-  combine different pandas dataframes?
  - stack the dataframes horizontally
    - df1.append(df2)
  - stack dataframes vertically
    - pd.concat([df1, df2])
  - extracting data from various dataframes having one or more common columns
    - df1.join(df2)
- create a series from the dictionary object in pandas
  - One dimensional array capable of storing different data types is called a series
  - [series_from_dictionary](series_from_dictionary.py)
- identify and deal with missing values in a dataframe?
  - identify if a dataframe has missing values by using the isnull() and isna() methods.
    - missing_data_count=df.isnull().sum()
  - handle missing values by either replacing the values in the column with 0 as follows:
    - df[‘column_name’].fillna(0)
  - Or by replacing it with the mean value of the column
    - df[‘column_name’] = df[‘column_name’].fillna((df[‘column_name’].mean()))
