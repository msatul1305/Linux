-> set current project path in python:

r("C:\\") : r before the string disables the processing of escape sequences.


-> How can I print variable and string on same line in Python?
  1. Use , to separate strings and variables while printing:
  print("If there was a birth every 7 seconds, there would be: ", var, "births")
  , in print function separates the items by a single space:
  
  2. or better use string formatting:
  print("If there was a birth every 7 seconds, there would be: {} births".format(births))
 
 -> String formatting in python:
  >>> print("{:d} {:03d} {:>20f}".format(1, 2, 1.1))
  1 002             1.100000
    ^^^
    0's padded to 2
    
 -> use + : print("hello"+str(var1)+str(var2))


Abstract class in python:
ABC = ABSTRACT BASE CLASSES
1. Can't be instantiated(i.e. can't create object of the class) but can be inherited i.e. blueprint for other classes
2. Abstract method - method without implementation
3. EG. 
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class AbstractClassName(ABC):
 @abstractmethod
 def abstract_method_name(self):
  Pass
