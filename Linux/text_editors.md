- vi, vim: The granddaddy of Unix text editors, 
  - vi, is infamous for its obtuse user interface. 
  - On the bright side, vi is powerful, lightweight, and fast. 
  - Learning vi is a Unix rite of passage, since it is universally available on Unix-like systems. 
  - On most Linux distributions, an enhanced version of vi called vim is provided in place of vi.
- Emacs: The true giant in the world of text editors is Emacs originally written by Richard Stallman. 
  - Emacs contains (or can be made to contain) every feature ever conceived of for a text editor.
  - It should be noted that vi and Emacs fans fight bitter religious wars over which is better.
- nano:	nano is a free clone of the text editor supplied with the pine email program. 
  - nano is very easy to use but is very short on features compared to vim and emacs. 
  - nano is recommended for first-time users who need a command line editor.
- gedit: gedit is the editor supplied with the GNOME desktop environment. 
  - gedit is easy to use and contains enough features to be a good beginners-level editor.
- kwrite: kwrite is the "advanced editor" supplied with KDE. 
  - It has syntax highlighting, a helpful feature for programmers and scriptwriters.
