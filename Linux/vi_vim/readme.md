- written in 1976 by Bill Joy, a University of California at Berkley 
- student who later went on to co-found Sun Microsystems.
- vi derives its name from the word “visual,” because it was intended to allow editing on a video terminal with a moving cursor.
- "Vi" and "Vim" share many common commands because 
  - Vim is an extended and improved version of Vi written by Bram Moolenaar.
  - However, Vim adds numerous enhancements and features to the basic commands available in Vi. 
  - Here is a list of common Vi/Vim commands and notes any differences between the two:
- Navigation Commands:
  - h: Move left.
  - j: Move down.
  - k: Move up.
  - l: Move right.
  - w: Move to the beginning of the next word.
  - b: Move to the beginning of the previous word.
  - e: Move to the end of the current word.
  - 0: Move to the beginning of the line.

- deleting text
  - x The current character
  - 3x The current character and the next two characters

  - d20G From the current line to the twentieth line of the file
- Global Search-and-Replace
  - : The colon character starts an ex command.
  - % This specifies the range of lines for the operation. % is a shortcut meaning from the first line to the last line. Alternately,
    - the range could have been specified 1,5 (since our file is five 
    - lines long) or 1,$, which means “from line 1 to the last line in
    - the file.” If the range of lines is omitted, the operation is performed only on the current line.
  - s This specifies the operation. In this case, it’s substitution(search-and-replace).
  - /Line/line/ This specifies the search pattern and the replacement text.
  - g This means “global” in the sense that the search-and-replace is performed on every instance of the search string in the line. If 
    - omitted, only the first instance of the search string on each line is replaced.
- Switching Between Files
  - To switch from one file to the next, use this ex command:
    - :bn
  - To move back to the previous file use the following:
    - :bp
