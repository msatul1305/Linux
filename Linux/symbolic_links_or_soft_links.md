- soft links
  - special type of file that contains a text pointer to the referenced file or directory.
  - same as a Windows shortcut
  - if we write something to the symbolic link, the referenced file is written to.
  - when we delete a symbolic link, only the link is deleted, not the file itself.
  - If the file is deleted before the symbolic link, the link will continue to exist but will point to nothing.
    - the link is said to be broken
  - e.g. lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 11 2007-08-11 07:34 libc.so.6 -> libc-2.6.so
    - first letter of the listing is “l”
    - called a symbolic link (also known as a soft link or symlink)
    - file referenced by multiple names
  - Creating a soft link 
    - ln -s [target] [link_name]
    - e.g. ln -s myfile.txt mylink
      - lrwxrwxrwx  1 atul atul     10 Sep 23 12:56 mylink -> myfile.txt
    - ln -nfs [target] [link_name]
      - -n: no dereference
       - used when you want to create a symbolic link to a directory but don't want the link to behave as if it's pointing to the contents of the directory.
         - e.g. ln -nfs /path/to/mydir mylink
      - -f: "force."
      - -s: symbolic link/soft link
      - create a symbolic link to a directory itself, rather than the directory's contents.
- hard links
  - allow files to have multiple names
  - When we create a hard link, we create an additional directory entry for a file
  - e.g. ```ln source_file link_name```
  - creates multiple directory entries that point to the same underlying data blocks on the storage device. 
  - Changes made to the source file or the hard link will affect both since they share the same data.
  - limitations:
    - A hard link cannot reference a file outside its own file system. 
    - i.e. a link cannot reference a file that is not on the same disk partition as the link itself.
    - A hard link may not reference a directory.
  - A hard link is indistinguishable from the file itself. 
  - Unlike a symbolic link, when we list a directory containing a hard link,
  - we will see no special indication of the link.
  - When a hard link is deleted, the link is removed but the contents of the file itself continue to exist 
  - (i.e. its space is not deallocated) until all links to the file are deleted.
