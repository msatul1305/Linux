- [hello_world.sh](hello_world.sh)
- The first line of the script is a special construct, called a ***shebang***, 
  - given to the system indicating what program is to be used to interpret the script.
- The second line is a comment. Bash ignores everything that appears after a "#" symbol. 
- give the shell permission to execute our script
  - chmod 755 hello_world
- run
  - ./hello_world.sh
- the shell maintains a list of directories where executable files (programs) are kept, 
- and only searches the directories on that list.
- This list of directories is called our path
  - echo $PATH
- add directories to the path
  - export PATH=$PATH:directory
- A better way would be to edit our .bash_profile file to include the above command. 
  - That way, it would be done automatically every time we log in.
- each user has a specific directory for the programs they personally use. 
  - This directory is called bin
- If we move or copy our script into our new bin directory we'll be all set. Now we just have to type:
  - hello_world
  - and our script will run.
- ENV variables
  - startup -> env var for all users -> env var personal
  - startup files
    - Login shells
      - /etc/profile	A global configuration script that applies to all users.
      - ~/.bash_profile	A user's personal startup file. Can be used to extend or override settings in the global configuration script.
      - ~/.bash_login	If ~/.bash_profile is not found, bash attempts to read this script.
      - ~/.profile	If neither ~/.bash_profile nor ~/.bash_login is found, bash attempts to read this file. This is the default in Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu.
      - Non-login shell
        - /etc/bash.bashrc	A global configuration script that applies to all users.
