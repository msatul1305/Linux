- [hello_world.sh](hello_world.sh)
- The first line of the script is a special construct, called a ***shebang***, 
  - given to the system indicating what program is to be used to interpret the script.
- The second line is a comment. Bash ignores everything that appears after a "#" symbol. 
- give the shell permission to execute our script
  - chmod 755 hello_world
- run
  - ./hello_world.sh
- the shell maintains a list of directories where executable files (programs) are kept, 
- and only searches the directories on that list.
- This list of directories is called our path
  - echo $PATH
- add directories to the path
  - export PATH=$PATH:directory
- A better way would be to edit our .bash_profile file to include the above command. 
  - That way, it would be done automatically every time we log in.
- each user has a specific directory for the programs they personally use. 
  - This directory is called bin
- If we move or copy our script into our new bin directory we'll be all set. Now we just have to type:
  - hello_world
  - and our script will run.
