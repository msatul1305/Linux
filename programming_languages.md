- India
  - Kojo
    - Developer: Lalit Pant, from India 
    - Type: Educational programming language & environment 
    - Purpose: Designed to help kids learn programming, math, and logic using a Scala-based environment. 
    - Features: Visual programming, turtle graphics, and integration with music and geometry. 
  - Vedic Programming Language (VPL) (experimental)
    - Inspiration: Based on Vedic Mathematics concepts 
    - Status: Not widely adopted, mostly academic or research-based 
    - Use: Aimed at creating efficient algorithms using ancient Indian math principles 
    - Fun fact: Some educational institutions explored this for teaching optimization and logic. 
  - Bharat Programming Language (proposed)
    - There have been discussions in the Indian developer community about creating an 
      - Indian-language-based programming language — 
      - especially one with syntax in Hindi or other native languages. 
      - Some experimental projects tried this but haven't gone mainstream yet. 
  - Sandesha 
    - Purpose: Messaging protocol implementation using SOAP 
    - Developed at: Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), involvement in Apache Axis2 
    - Not a language, but shows India's involvement in protocol/tool development. 
  - Bonus: Experimental Languages in Indian Languages 
    - Several GitHub projects and hackathons have tried creating programming languages 
      - that use Hindi/Tamil/Bengali syntax — mainly for fun or accessibility. 
    - Examples:
      - "BhaiLang" – a humorous pseudo-language with Hindi-English syntax (fun project, check it out on GitHub)
      - "Sanskrit-based programming" ideas in academic papers
- India’s contributions
  - Apache Hadoop – Co-created by Arun Murthy, Indian origin. 
  - Apache Ambari – Indian engineers at Hortonworks.
