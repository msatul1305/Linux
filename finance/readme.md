    - CET1: The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio is a key financial metric used to measure a bank's capital adequacy and financial stability. It represents the ratio of a bank's core equity capital to its risk-weighted assets (RWA). Core equity capital includes common shares and retained earnings, while risk-weighted assets are assets on a bank's balance sheet that are weighted based on their credit risk.
      - The CET1 ratio is calculated as follows:
        - CET1 Ratio=Common Equity Tier 1 Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets Ã—100%
      - The Basel III framework sets minimum capital requirements for banks, including a minimum CET1 ratio to ensure they have enough high-quality capital to withstand financial shocks and continue operating smoothly.
