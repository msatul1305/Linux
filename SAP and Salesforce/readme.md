- ***CRM vs ERP***
  - Businesses looking to automate core business processes typically look at two main software solutions, 
    - enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM). 
    - ERP helps companies run successful businesses by connecting their financial and 
      - operational systems to a central database
    - while CRM helps manage how customers interact with their businesses.
  - Both serve as vital data repositories. 
  - ERP is primarily for financial data and the finance department, 
  - while CRM is customer data used by the sales and customer service departments. 
  - Nearly all growing companies, from small and midsize businesses (SMBs) to enterprises, 
    - will eventually need both an ERP and a CRM system
  - Some ERP systems include a CRM component, while others do not, 
    - but CRM software systems do not include ERP components.
