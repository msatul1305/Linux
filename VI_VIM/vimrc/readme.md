vimrc
ChatGPT
To create or edit your .vimrc file, you can use the following steps:

Open a terminal.
Type vim ~/.vimrc and press Enter. This command opens the .vimrc file in Vim for editing.
Add your desired configurations to the .vimrc file. For example, you can set tab settings, enable line numbers, or add custom key mappings.
Save the changes and exit Vim by pressing Esc to ensure you're in normal mode, then type :wq and press Enter. This command writes the changes to the file and quits Vim.
Here's an example of a basic .vimrc file with some common settings:

vim
Copy code
" Enable line numbers
set number

" Use spaces instead of tabs
set expandtab
set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4

" Enable syntax highlighting
syntax on

" Highlight search results as you type
set incsearch

" Highlight current line
set cursorline

" Enable mouse in all modes
set mouse=a

" Enable file type detection
filetype on
Feel free to customize these settings to suit your preferences and workflow.
