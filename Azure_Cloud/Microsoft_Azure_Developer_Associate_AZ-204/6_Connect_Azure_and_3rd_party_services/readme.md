- Event vs Messages
    - Events
      - lightweight notification of state change
        - generally, does not include data that is changed
      - publisher does not know or care how message is handled
        - e.g. file upload
          - system says we have new file but don't care about its usage by other system
      - follows a pub/sub model
    - Messages
      - app data from a source system to be consumed
        - e.g. new purchase order
      - message will be handled by a receiver
      - can follow pub/sub or producer/consumer model
