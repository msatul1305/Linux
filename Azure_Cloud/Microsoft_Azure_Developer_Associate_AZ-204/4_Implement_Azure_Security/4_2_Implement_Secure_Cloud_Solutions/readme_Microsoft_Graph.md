  - Use Microsoft Graph in .net app
  - Common functions in Microsoft Graph API
    - Authentication
      - M Graph uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication
      - we need to obtain access token to make authenticated API calls.
      - common endpoints: ```/oauth2/token, /oauth2/v2.0/token```
    - Accessing User Data
      - profile info
      - mail
      - calendar
      - contacts 
      - onedrive files etc.
      - common endpoints: ```/me, /users/{id}, /me/mail, /me/events, /me/contacts, /me/drive``` etc.
    - Working with groups
      - m365 groups and security groups
      - ```/groups, /groups/{id}, /me/memberOf``` etc.
    - Managing files and folders
      - ```/me/drive, /me/drive/root/children, /me/drive/items/{id}```, etc.
    - working with messages and mailboxes
      - ```/me/messages, /me/mailFolders, /me/mailFolders/{id}/messages,``` etc.
    - working with calendar events
      - ```/me/events, /me/calendarView, /me/calendars/{id}/events,``` etc

- Microsoft Graph Best Practices
  - Authentication
    - HTTP Authorization request header, as a Bearer token
    - graph client constructor, when using Microsoft Graph client library
  - Consent and Authorization
    - use the least privilege
    - use the correct permission type based on scenarios
    - consider end user and admin experience
    - consider end user and admin
    - Generally,
      - All app level permissions require admin consent.
      - some delegated permissions also require admin consent.
        - e.g. ```people.read.all```
  - Handle responses effectively
    - pagination
      - divide data into pages if we receive a lot of data back from Microsoft Graph.
    - evolvable enumerations
    - Storing data locally
