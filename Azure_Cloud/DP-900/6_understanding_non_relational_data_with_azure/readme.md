  - Non-relational data
    - Azure Table Storage
      - scalable key-value store in the cloud
      - items = rows
      - fields = columns
      - no relationship keys or stored procedures
      - denormalized data
        - all data stored in single row
      - grouping of related rows based on the partition key
      - advantages
        - simple to scale
        - semi-structured data
        - no complex relationship
        - fast row insertion
        - fast data retrival
        - high-availability in single region
          - data copied multiple time into single region
        - Use cases
          - supports large volume of data (100s of TBs)
            - e-commerce applications
          - fast access to denormalized data
          - simple structure, no joins
          - IoT Systems
          - Event logging
          - performance monitoring
          - fast analysis of data based on time or datetime
            - store partition by time
            - store partition by type
          - proper security and role-based access required to be maintained
      - Azure portal -> storage account -> Tables -> +Table -> Storage explorer -> Tables -> Add
        - partition_key = p1, row_key=r1
        - Add property ...
    - Azure Blob Storage
      - binary large object
      - blobs
        - block blob
          - set of blocks
          - the size of each block can vary but have max 100 MB
          - used to store discrete large blob that changes ***infrequently***        
        - page blob
          - organized as a collection of fixed sizes, 512-byte pages
          - optimized to support random reads and writes
          - Azure uses page blobs to implement virtual disk storage for virtual machines
        - Append blob
          - block blob optimized to support append operations
          - not possible to update or delete existing blobs
          - can only append new blob at the end of previous blob
      - Container groups related blobs
        - container provides a way for grouping of various blobs
        - also provides security measures for read and write
      - 3 tier access
        - HOT
        - COLD
        - ARCHIVE
      - Advantages of blob storage
        - data is redundant (3 times in region)
        - versioning
        - soft delete
        - snapshot
          - read-only version of blob
        - change feed
          - read-only records of all updates made to the blob
          - for audit and analysis of change in the blob object
      - use cases of Azure Blob Storage
        - Serving images/docs from browser
        - Streaming audio and video
        - Storing data for backups and store
      - Azure portal -> Storage account -> containers -> +container -> name -> upload 
    - Azure File Storage

        - encryption in transit also available
      - Azure portal -> storage account -> File shares -> +File Share -> name -> Quota 1 GB -> upload.
    - Azure Cosmos DB
      - multi-model noSQL db
