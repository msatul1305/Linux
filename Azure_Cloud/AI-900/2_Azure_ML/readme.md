                - Season detail
            - Labels(what we want to predict): y
                - number of bicycles rented
        - Model => f(x)=y
    - Health clinic
        - ***Classification model***(classify into categories)
            - takes measurement from patients
                - Features(x)
                    - Blood Pressure
                    - Glucose level

                - Labels(y)
                    - Diabetic or Non-Diabetic
    - Flower shop
        - ***Clusterization***(grouping data based on similarities) - Unsupervised learning
            - Features
                - measurement of flower
                - petal count
            - Label is unknown(we do not know output)
- Training methodology
    - Data Ingestion
    - Prepare data
    - pre-process data
        - Feature selection
        - data cleaning
            - remove outliers and errors
            - replace missing values with suitable values
        - Feature engineering
            - derive new features from existing
        - Normalize numeric features so they are on the same scale
    - prepare model
        - using algorithm
            - to fit input data and predict features
- Regression model
    - Supervised Machine Learning model
        - train model using data
            - data
                - feature and
                - known values for labels
    - train and publish using Azure Machine Learning Designer(GUI) - drag and drop
        - train regression model
        - use for inferencing
        - deploy regression model as a service
    - Use case example
        - Automobile industry
            - Features
                - Engine Size
                - No of seats
                - Mileage
            - Labels
                - Likely Selling Price
- Classification
  - Supervised Machine Learning Technique
  - e.g. Two-Class Logistic Regression
  - train ML model to predict which category or class an item belongs to
    - e.g. Health clinic uses 
      - Features: characteristics of patient
        - like age, weight, blood pressure
      - Label: Predict Diabetic or Non-Diabetic
        - if patient is at risk of diabetes
  - using Azure ML Designer
- Compute Targets
  - Compute Instances: Development workstations that data scientists can use to work with data and models.
  - Compute Clusters: Scalable clusters of virtual machines for on-demand processing of experiment code. 
  - Inference Clusters: Deployment targets for predictive services that use your trained models.
