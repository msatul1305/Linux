              - Data origin and Lineage
                - Public vs private data sets
              - Data use
                - Internal vs external
              - Data corruption considerations
                - anomaly detection, changes in data
        - Inclusiveness
            - empower everyone,
            - benefit all regardless of physical ability, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity etc.
        - Transparency
          - systems should be understandable
          - users must be aware of 
            - purpose of the system, 
            - how it works and 
            - its limitations 
          - users must understand behaviour of the AI systems
            - Interoperability
            - Intelligibility
        - Accountability
