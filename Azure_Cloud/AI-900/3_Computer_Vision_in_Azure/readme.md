- ***Azure Computer Vision Services***
  - 2 Cognitive Services
    - ***Computer Vision***
      - ***Form recognizer***
        - extracts key-value pairs and tables from documents
        - read text in images
        - receipt processing
      - ***Face detector***
        - recognize and detect face in images
      - Use cases
        - interpret images and suggest captions
        - Suggest tags for images
        - categorize images
        - identify objects in images
        - detect faces in images
        - recognize celebrities and landmarks in images
        - read text in images
    - ***Custom Vision***
      - train custom image classification
      - object detection models using own images
- Image Analysis with Azure
  - Image Classification
    - classes to which an image belongs are known
    - e.g. classify images of flowers based on:
      - Features:
        - measurements of petals, stem, sepals etc.
      - Label:
        - Species of flower
    - Uses Supervised ML:
      - Deep Learning
      - Convolutional Neural Networks
      - Patterns in Pixels
    - Use cases for Image Classification
      - Product identification
        - Visual searches for specific products
        - online searches
        - searching in store in mobile
      - Disaster Investigation
        - evaluating infrastructure from disaster preparation efforts
        - e.g. aerial surveillance and classification of bridges
      - Medical diagnosis
        - evaluating images from x-rays, MRIs, CT scans
        - and classify specific issues as cancerous tumors or other medical conditions
