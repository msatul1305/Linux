- UMl(Unified Modeling Language)
  - used for 
    - visualizing, 
    - specifying, 
    - constructing, 
    - and documenting the artifacts of software systems.
  - overview of some key UML diagrams and concepts:
    - Use Case Diagrams:
      - depict the interactions between a system and its external users (actors) to describe the system's functionality. 
    - Class Diagrams
      - represent the static structure of a system, showing 
        - classes, attributes, operations/methods, and relationships 
        - between classes (like inheritance, association, aggregation, and composition). 
      - used for designing and understanding the structure of a system.
    - Sequence Diagrams:
      - illustrate how objects interact in a particular scenario of a use case. 
      - show the flow of messages between objects over time, highlighting the order of interactions and the objects involved.
    - Activity Diagrams:
      - visualize the flow of activities or actions within a system, showing the sequence of activities and decision points. 
      - used to model the workflow in a system or a specific use case.
    - State Machine Diagrams
      - represent the states of an object and transitions between these states in response to events. 
      - useful for modeling the behavior of objects that have different states during their lifetime.
    - Component Diagrams
      - show the components of a system
        - their interfaces, dependencies, and relationships.
        - used to visualize the physical components of a system and their interactions.
    - Deployment Diagrams
      - depict the physical deployment of software components in a system, 
      - showing how software is installed on hardware nodes and how they are connected.
