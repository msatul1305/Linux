To view GUI applications in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you need to have an X server installed on your Windows machine and set up the DISPLAY environment variable in WSL to point to the X server. Here's a general outline of the steps:

Install an X server on Windows:
You can use X410, VcXsrv, or any other X server for Windows. Install the X server and start it.

Set the DISPLAY environment variable in WSL:
Open a terminal in WSL and set the DISPLAY variable to point to your Windows machine's IP address and the display number used by the X server. Replace IP_ADDRESS with your Windows machine's IP address:

bash
Copy code
export DISPLAY=IP_ADDRESS:0
If you are using X410, the IP address should be localhost.

Install a GUI application in WSL (if not already installed):
You can install GUI applications in WSL using the package manager of your Linux distribution. For example, to install gedit on Ubuntu, you can use:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gedit
Run the GUI application:
Run the GUI application from the terminal. For example, to run gedit, you would use:

bash
Copy code
gedit
This should launch the GUI application, and you should see its window on your Windows desktop. Note that not all GUI applications may work perfectly in WSL due to differences in the graphics stack between Windows and Linux.
